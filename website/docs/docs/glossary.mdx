## API

[api]: /terraform/docs/glossary#api
[apis]: /terraform/docs/glossary#api

Acronym for "Application Programming Interface". Any interface designed to allow programmatic manipulation of some kind of software system. For most software developers today, the most common kinds of APIs are based on HTTP requests.

Terraform relies on cloud service provider APIs to manage resources; each service's Terraform provider is responsible for mapping Terraform's resource model to the series of actual API calls necessary to create, check, modify, or delete a real infrastructure resource in that cloud service.

HCP Terraform also offers its own API, for managing resources like team membership, policies, and workspaces. That API, in turn, is used by the `tfe` Terraform provider, so you can use Terraform to manage the system that runs Terraform for you.

- [HCP Terraform: API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs)
- [Terraform providers: `tfe`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs)

## Apply (noun)

[apply]: /terraform/docs/glossary#apply-noun-
[applies]: /terraform/docs/glossary#apply-noun-

One of the stages of a [run][], in which changes are made to real infrastructure resources in order to make them match their desired state. The counterpart of a [plan][].

In Terraform's CLI, applies are performed with the `terraform apply` command. HCP Terraform runs `terraform apply` using a [plan file][] as its input.

- [Terraform: The `terraform apply` command](/terraform/cli/commands/apply)
- [HCP Terraform: About Runs](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations)

## Apply (verb)

[apply-v]: /terraform/docs/glossary#apply-verb-

To make changes to real infrastructure in order to make it match the desired state (as specified by a Terraform [config][] and set of [variables][]).

In conversation, it's common to refer to "applying a [plan][]" (usually in the context of HCP Terraform's workflow) or "applying a [configuration][]" (usually in the context of the Terraform CLI workflow).

- [Terraform: The `terraform apply` command](/terraform/cli/commands/apply)
- [HCP Terraform: About Runs](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations)

## Argument

[argument]: /terraform/docs/glossary#argument
[arguments]: /terraform/docs/glossary#argument

In Terraform's [configuration][] language: a syntax construct that assigns a value to a name. Arguments have the form `<IDENTIFIER> = <EXPRESSION>`, and they appear within blocks.

Most of a Terraform configuration consists of using arguments to configure Terraform [resources][]. Each resource type defines the arguments its resources can use, the allowed values for each argument, and which arguments are required or optional. Information about a given resource type can be found in the docs for that resource's [provider][].

- [Terraform Language docs: Syntax — Arguments and Blocks](/terraform/language/syntax/configuration#arguments-and-blocks)

## Attribute

[attribute]: /terraform/docs/glossary#attribute
[attributes]: /terraform/docs/glossary#attribute

In Terraform's [configuration][] language: a named piece of data that belongs to some kind of object. The value of an attribute can be referenced in [expressions][] using a dot-separated notation, like `aws_instance.example.id`.

Terraform [resources][] and [data sources][] make all of their [arguments][] available as readable attributes, and also typically export additional read-only attributes.

- [Terraform docs: Expressions — Indices and Attributes](/terraform/language/expressions#indices-and-attributes)

## Backend

[backend]: /terraform/docs/glossary#backend
[backends]: /terraform/docs/glossary#backend

The part of Terraform's core that determines how Terraform stores [state][] and performs [operations][remote operations] (like [plan][], [apply][], import, etc.). Terraform has multiple backends to choose from, which can be configured in a variety of ways. Backends are not plugins, so it is not possible to install additional backends.

In a general computer science sense, a backend is any lower-level implementation that enables a higher-level feature. But in the context of Terraform, "backend" always means the built-in code that handles state and operations.

- [Terraform docs: Backends](/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration)

## Blob Storage

[blob storage]: /terraform/docs/glossary#blob-storage

The blob storage API service for HCP Terraform stores and retrieves arbitrary chunks of data using opaque addresses. The opaque addresses are then indexed by a directory of some kind. The most notable example is AWS's [S3][].

You do not need to be familiar with the properties and advantages of blob storage services in order to work with Terraform or HCP Terraform. However, you might need to administer or configure a blob storage service if you are responsible for administering a [Terraform Enterprise][] instance.

## Block

[block]: /terraform/docs/glossary#block
[blocks]: /terraform/docs/glossary#block

In Terraform's [configuration][] language: a container for other content which usually represents the configuration of some kind of object, like a [resource][]. Blocks have a _block type,_ can have zero or more _labels,_ and have a _body_ that contains any number of [arguments][] and nested blocks. Most of Terraform's features are controlled by top-level blocks in a configuration file.

```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = var.base_cidr_block
}

<BLOCK TYPE> "<BLOCK LABEL>" "<BLOCK LABEL>" {
  # Block body
  <IDENTIFIER> = <EXPRESSION> # Argument
}
```

- [Terraform Language docs: Syntax — Arguments and Blocks](/terraform/language/syntax/configuration#arguments-and-blocks)

## Branch

[branch]: /terraform/docs/glossary#branch
[branches]: /terraform/docs/glossary#branch

In some [version control systems][vcs]: a semi-independent history of changes to content in a repository. A branch generally shares some history with other branches in the same repository, but eventually diverges to include changes that aren't yet present elsewhere.

A repository usually has a default branch (whose name, in [Git][], defaults to `master`), which successful changes are eventually merged into. Most modern development workflows also include topic branches (where a specific set of changes is explored, iterated on, and verified), and some workflows include long-lived branches other than the default branch.

## CI/CD

[ci-cd]: /terraform/docs/glossary#ci-cd

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) platforms perform pre-defined tasks (like tests or builds) in response to trigger events (like new commits in a project). This helps make new releases more automated, predictable, and understandable. Infrastructure management, typically handled by operations teams, can also fit into an automated release workflow using infrastructure as code with Terraform.

## CLI

[cli]: /terraform/docs/glossary#cli

Command-line interface. The `terraform` command expects to be run in a CLI (a Unix shell or the Windows command prompt), which it uses to accept instructions and return text output.

We often use "Terraform CLI" to refer to the core Terraform Community edition binary when we need to distinguish it from other parts of the Terraform ecosystem (like HCP Terraform or the Terraform GitHub Actions).

- [Wikipedia: Command-line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
- [Terraform docs: Commands (CLI)](/terraform/cli/commands)

## Commit

[commit]: /terraform/docs/glossary#commit
[commits]: /terraform/docs/glossary#commit

In a [version control system][vcs]: A coherent set of changes saved to a repository's version history.

In Git, commits act like a complete snapshot of the contents of a repo, on a specific [branch][] (or group of branches with shared history) and at a specific moment in time. Each commit also records the identity of its parent(s), which enables viewing the entire history of the repo up to any specific moment. Additionally, comparing a commit to its parent(s) can reveal the exact changes introduced by that commit; if those changes are applied as a diff, they can be added to a different branch in the repo without merging in the entire history of the commit in question.

## (Terraform) Configuration

[configuration]: /terraform/docs/glossary#terraform-configuration
[configurations]: /terraform/docs/glossary#terraform-configuration
[config]: /terraform/docs/glossary#terraform-configuration
[configs]: /terraform/docs/glossary#terraform-configuration

Also "config".

Code written in [Terraform's configuration language][hcl] that declaratively describes the desired state of your infrastructure. A complete config consists of a [root module][], which can optionally call any number of child [modules][].

- [Terraform docs: Configuration Language](/terraform/language)
- [Introduction to Terraform](/terraform/intro)

## Configuration Version

[configuration version]: /terraform/docs/glossary#configuration-version
[configuration versions]: /terraform/docs/glossary#configuration-version
[config version]: /terraform/docs/glossary#configuration-version
[config versions]: /terraform/docs/glossary#configuration-version

### HCP Terraform

Also "config version".

The contents of a Terraform [config][] at a specific moment in time. This concept only applies to HCP Terraform, since the Terraform CLI doesn't have visibility into repeated runs for a specific configuration over a period of time.

Every stage of a given run uses one specific configuration version.

Config versions can be automatically imported when new commits are merged to a workspace's repo, uploaded via the API, or uploaded by running `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` as a [remote operation][]. Adding a new config version is sometimes called "[ingressing][ingress]."

## Cost Estimation

[cost estimation]: /terraform/docs/glossary#cost-estimation
[cost estimations]: /terraform/docs/glossary#cost-estimation

### HCP Terraform

Part of a [run][]. After gathering the [plan file][] for a run, HCP Terraform uses plan data to estimate costs for each resource found in the [plan][]. Previous and proposed resources are given estimated costs, providing an estimated delta cost between the two. The results can be used in [Sentinel policies][].

- [HCP Terraform docs: Run States and Stages](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/states)

## Data Source

[data source]: /terraform/docs/glossary#data-source
[data sources]: /terraform/docs/glossary#data-source

A [resource][]-like object that can be configured in Terraform's [configuration][] language.

Unlike resources, data sources do not create or manage infrastructure. Instead, they return information about some kind of external object in the form of readable [attributes][]. This allows a Terraform configuration to make use of information defined outside of Terraform, or defined by another separate Terraform configuration.

Data sources are implemented by [providers][].

- [Terraform docs: Data Sources](/terraform/language/data-sources)

## Deposed

[deposed]: /terraform/docs/glossary#deposed
[deposed resource]: /terraform/docs/glossary#deposed
[deposed resources]: /terraform/docs/glossary#deposed

This status tracks a [resource][] that was marked for deletion, but still remains in the Terraform [state][] and infrastructure due an error from a previous [apply][]. Terraform expected to replace the existing resource by creating a new resource, then destroying the existing resource, but an error occurred in the apply before the destruction. Existing references to the resource refer to the new resource. Terraform will destroy the `deposed` resource on the next apply. This only can occur in resource [configurations][] that have the `lifecycle` configuration block `create_before_destroy` [argument][] set to `true`.

- [Terraform docs: Resources](/terraform/language/resources)

## Expression

[expression]: /terraform/docs/glossary#expression
[expressions]: /terraform/docs/glossary#expression

In Terraform's [configuration][] language: a piece of syntax that represents a value, either literally or by referencing and combining other values. Expressions appear as values for [arguments][], or within other expressions.

Prior to Terraform 0.12, \[interpolation]\[] was the only way to use non-literal expressions in Terraform configurations; in 0.12 and later, expressions can be used independently.

- [Terraform docs: Expressions](/terraform/language/expressions)

## Fork

[fork]: /terraform/docs/glossary#fork
[forks]: /terraform/docs/glossary#fork
[forked]: /terraform/docs/glossary#fork

Also "forked repository" or "forked repo".

A [VCS][] [repository][] that was created by copying content and history from another repository.

Different VCS providers handle forks differently, but a fork is usually owned by a different person or organization than the original repo, and a fork usually does not inherit all of the original repo's access permissions.

HCP Terraform makes extensive use of VCS repos, and assumes that forks of a trusted repo are not necessarily trusted. As such, HCP Terraform avoids evaluating any code from external forks, which prevents HCP Terraform from running [speculative plans][] for [pull requests][] from forks.

On [Terraform Enterprise][], [speculative plans][] on [pull requests][] from forks can be enabled by an administrator.

## Git

[git]: /terraform/docs/glossary#git

A distributed [version control system][vcs] for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.

- [Wikipedia: Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

## HCL

[hcl]: /terraform/docs/glossary#hcl

HashiCorp Configuration Language. The structured configuration syntax that serves as the basis for Terraform's [configuration][] language, as well as the configuration layer for several other HashiCorp products.

HCL establishes the syntax Terraform uses for things like [arguments][], [blocks][], literal values, and [expressions][]. But what most people think of as the Terraform language extends beyond just the syntax; the built-in functions, Terraform-specific block types (like `resource` and `variable`), and Terraform-specific named values available in expressions are all implementation details of Terraform itself.

- [GitHub: HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl)
- [Terraform docs: Configuration Language](/terraform/language)

## ID

[id]: /terraform/docs/glossary#id
[ids]: /terraform/docs/glossary#id

An identifier; an opaque string permanently associated with a specific object, which doesn't contain any information about the object but which can be used to retrieve information about it or perform actions on it via an [API][].

In Terraform, many [resource][] types have an ID [attribute][] that helps link Terraform's [state][] to the real infrastructure resource being managed.

In HCP Terraform, most internal application objects (like [workspaces][], users, [policies][], etc.) can be identified by both a name and by an opaque, permanent ID. Most API endpoints use IDs instead of names, since names sometimes change. IDs for HCP Terraform's application objects are sometimes called "external IDs."

You can usually copy an external ID from the URL bar when viewing an object in HCP Terraform's UI. Workspaces don't display an ID in the URL bar, but their general settings page includes a UI control for viewing and copying the ID.

## Infrastructure as Code

[infrastructure-as-code]: /terraform/docs/glossary#infrastructure-as-code

Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is the practice of managing infrastructure in a file or files rather than manually configuring it via a user interface. Infrastructure resource types managed with IaC can include virtual machines, security groups, network interfaces, and many others.

## Ingress

[ingress]: /terraform/docs/glossary#ingress
[ingressing]: /terraform/docs/glossary#ingress

### HCP Terraform

The process of bringing content into HCP Terraform. Usually that content is a [configuration version][], but it can also be a [private module][] version or some other kind of content.

This term comes from HCP Terraform's internal subsystems. Most documentation and UI avoids using "ingress," but it can sometimes appear in API contexts or support conversations.

## Input Variables

See [Variables][].

## Interpolation

Using a special placeholder to insert a computed value into a string.

[Terraform's configuration language][hcl] supports interpolation in strings using `${<EXPRESSION>}` placeholders. For example:

```hcl
"Hello, ${var.name}!"
```

Prior to Terraform 0.12, interpolation was the only way to use non-literal [expressions][] in Terraform configurations; in 0.12 and later, expressions can be used independently.

Interpolation is a very common feature in programming languages; for example, Ruby uses `#{<EXPRESSION>}` placeholders in double-quoted strings, and JavaScript (ES6 and up) uses `${<EXPRESSION>}` placeholders in backtick-quoted strings.

- [Terraform docs: Expressions - String Templates](/terraform/language/expressions#string-templates)

## JSON

[json]: /terraform/docs/glossary#json

Acronym for "JavaScript Object Notation". A popular text-based data interchange format, which can represent strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects/maps.

Terraform and HCP Terraform often interact with JSON data in order to consume or provide APIs. Terraform also supports JSON as an alternate format for [configurations][].

- [Wikipedia: JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json)
- [Terraform docs: JSON Configuration Syntax](/terraform/language/syntax/json)

## Locking

[locking]: /terraform/docs/glossary#locking
[lock]: /terraform/docs/glossary#locking

### HCP Terraform

The ability to prevent new [runs][] from starting in a given [workspace][]. Workspaces are automatically locked while a run is in progress, and can also be manually locked.

The [`remote` backend][remote backend] respects the lock status in HCP Terraform workspaces. Some other Terraform [backends][] can also lock state during runs.

## Log

[log]: /terraform/docs/glossary#log
[logs]: /terraform/docs/glossary#log

The text-based output of actions taken within a [run][]. For example, the output of running `terraform plan`.

## Module

[module]: /terraform/docs/glossary#module
[modules]: /terraform/docs/glossary#module

Also "Terraform module".

A self-contained collection of Terraform [configurations][] that manages a collection of related infrastructure resources.

Other Terraform configurations can _call_ a module, which tells Terraform to manage any resources described by that module.

Modules define [input variables][] (which the calling module can set values for) and [output values][] (which the calling module can reference in [expressions][]).

- [Terraform docs: Modules](/terraform/language/modules/develop)

## OAuth

[oauth]: /terraform/docs/glossary#oauth

An open standard for token-based authorization between applications on the internet.

HCP Terraform uses OAuth to connect your organization to your [VCS provider][]. Generally takes an `id` and `secret` from your VCS provider to give access to HCP Terraform and allow it to pull in configuration from the provider.

- [HCP Terraform docs: VCS Integration](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs)

## OAuth Client

[oauth client]: /terraform/docs/glossary#oauth-client
[oauth clients]: /terraform/docs/glossary#oauth-client

### HCP Terraform

An entity collecting the configuration information that an HCP Terraform organization needs in order to connect to a specific [VCS provider][].

An OAuth client needs an [OAuth token][] in order to actually access data belonging to a user or organization in that VCS provider. The client can be created with an existing token for that VCS provider (API-only, and not supported for some VCS providers), or it can be created with the details HCP Terraform needs in order to request a token. Requesting a token requires a user to click through and approve access with their VCS provider account.

- [HCP Terraform docs: VCS Integration](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs)
- [HCP Terraform API docs: OAuth Clients](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/oauth-clients)

## OAuth Token

[oauth token]: /terraform/docs/glossary#oauth-token
[oauth tokens]: /terraform/docs/glossary#oauth-token


**In general:** A secret string that allows an application to authenticate itself to another application. The token is generated ahead of time by the application being accessed (either during the OAuth authorization exchange or in response to a direct request by a user), and allows access with whatever permissions that application assigns to the token. The [VCS providers][] supported by HCP Terraform allow access via OAuth tokens; that access is generally restricted to data belonging to a given user or organization within that provider.

**Within HCP Terraform:** An entity in the HCP Terraform application that associates an OAuth token (in the "secret string" sense) with a permanent ID and with metadata about which VCS provider it applies to and which VCS user approved the token. When documentation refers specifically to this kind of entity, the name is often styled as `oauth-token` to indicate that it's an entity you can interact with via the [API][].

An `oauth-token` has a one-to-one relationship with an [OAuth client][], but the client can outlive a specific token, to allow revoking and re-requesting VCS access.

[Workspaces][] that are linked to a VCS [repo][] have a relationship with one `oauth-token`.

- [HCP Terraform docs: VCS Integration](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs)
- [HCP Terraform API docs: OAuth Tokens](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/oauth-tokens)

## Organization

[organization]: /terraform/docs/glossary#organization
[organizations]: /terraform/docs/glossary#organization

### HCP Terraform

HCP Terraform's fundamental unit for controlling access and grouping things together; meant to represent a company or a business unit within a company. An organization contains a group of [workspaces][], a group of [teams][], a group of [Sentinel policies][], and a variety of settings. Adding users to an organization is done via teams.

- [HCP Terraform docs: Organizations](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations)

## Output Values

[output value]: /terraform/docs/glossary#output-values
[output values]: /terraform/docs/glossary#output-values
[output]: /terraform/docs/glossary#output-values
[outputs]: /terraform/docs/glossary#output-values

Also "outputs".

Data exported by a Terraform [module][], which can be displayed to a user and/or programmatically used by other Terraform code.

## OSS

[oss]: /terraform/docs/glossary#oss

Acronym for "Open-Source Software". Publicly available Terraform providers are open-source. 

Terraform and all other HashiCorp products are accessible through a source-available license that allows broad copying, modification, and redistribution. HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise are closed-source commercial software, that make use of Terraform and the available Terraform providers.

- [Wikipedia: Open-Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)

## Permissions

[permission]: /terraform/docs/glossary#permissions
[permissions]: /terraform/docs/glossary#permissions

### HCP Terraform

Specific levels of access allowed within HCP Terraform. Can be managed at the [workspace][] and/or [organization][] level. For example, a user with "read" permissions for a workspace can see a list of runs but cannot approve a run like a user with "write" permissions can.

- [HCP Terraform docs: Permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions)

## Plan (verb)

[plan-v]: /terraform/docs/glossary#plan-verb-

Also "queue plan".

To start a new [run][], which begins by running a Terraform [plan (noun)][plan].

- [HCP Terraform docs: About Runs](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations)

## Plan (noun, 1)

[plan]: /terraform/docs/glossary#plan-noun-1-
[plans]: /terraform/docs/glossary#plan-noun-1-

One of the stages of a [run][], in which Terraform compares the managed infrastructure's real state to the [configuration][] and [variables][], determines which changes are necessary to make the real state match the desired state, and presents a human-readable summary to the user. The counterpart of an [apply][].

In Terraform's CLI, plans are performed by all of the following commands:

- `terraform plan`, which only performs a plan. It can optionally output a [plan file][], which `terraform apply` can use to perform that exact set of planned changes.
- `terraform apply`, which performs a plan and then, if a user approves, immediately applies it.
- `terraform destroy`, which is similar to `terraform apply` but uses a desired state in which none of the managed resources exist; if the plan is approved, those resources are destroyed.

In HCP Terraform, plans are performed by committing changes to a workspace's configuration, running `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` with the remote backend enabled, manually queueing a plan, or uploading a configuration via the API.

HCP Terraform's workflow always creates a [plan file][], which can be auto-applied or can wait for a user's approval. HCP Terraform also supports [speculative plans][], which are for informational purposes only and cannot be applied.

- [Terraform docs: The `terraform plan` command](/terraform/cli/commands/plan)
- [HCP Terraform docs: About Runs](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations)

## Plan File

[plan file]: /terraform/docs/glossary#plan-file
[plan files]: /terraform/docs/glossary#plan-file

Also "`.tfplan`", "saved plan", or simply "plan" in contexts where it's clearly referring to an artifact.

A binary artifact optionally produced by the `terraform plan` command, which `terraform apply` can use to carry out the exact changes that were decided at the time of the [plan][].

HCP Terraform always uses a saved plan as the input to an [apply][], so that applies never make changes that weren't shown to the user after the plan (in cases where the config or the variables changed in the meantime).

## Policy

[policy]: /terraform/docs/glossary#policy
[policies]: /terraform/docs/glossary#policy
[sentinel policy]: /terraform/docs/glossary#policy
[sentinel policies]: /terraform/docs/glossary#policy

### HCP Terraform

[Sentinel][] code that can be enforced on runs. Combined into [policy sets][].

- [HCP Terraform docs: Managing Sentinel Policies](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets)

## Policy Check

[policy check]: /terraform/docs/glossary#policy-check
[policy checks]: /terraform/docs/glossary#policy-check

### HCP Terraform

Part of a [run][]. After gathering the [configuration][], [state][], and [plan file][] for a run, HCP Terraform runs [Sentinel][] to check that data against the active [policies][]. Policy checks end in success or failure. If a failure occurs in a required policy, this can prevent the run from proceeding to the [apply][] stage.

- [HCP Terraform docs: Run States and Stages](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/states)

## Policy Set

[policy set]: /terraform/docs/glossary#policy-set
[policy sets]: /terraform/docs/glossary#policy-set

### HCP Terraform

A list of [Sentinel][] [policies][] to enforce globally or on specific workspaces.

- [HCP Terraform docs: Managing Sentinel Policies](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets)

## Private Terraform Registry

[private terraform registry]: /terraform/docs/glossary#private-terraform-registry
[private module registry]: /terraform/docs/glossary#private-terraform-registry
[private registry]: /terraform/docs/glossary#private-terraform-registry
[private module]: /terraform/docs/glossary#private-terraform-registry
[private modules]: /terraform/docs/glossary#private-terraform-registry

### HCP Terraform

Also "private module registry".

A version of the [Terraform Registry][] that is built-in to HCP Terraform, to enable code sharing within an organization. It includes a configuration designer, which lets you combine and configure modules to generate a Terraform [configuration][] that uses them.

- [HCP Terraform docs: Private Registry](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry)

## Private Terraform Enterprise (PTFE)

[private terraform enterprise]: /terraform/docs/glossary#private-terraform-enterprise-ptfe-
[private installs]: /terraform/docs/glossary#private-terraform-enterprise-ptfe-

[Terraform Enterprise][].

In April 2024, we renamed Terraform Cloud as HCP Terraform. Terraform Enterprise is the self-managed distribution of HCP Terraform. 

- [Terraform Enterprise docs](/terraform/enterprise)

## (Terraform) Provider

[provider]: /terraform/docs/glossary#terraform-provider
[providers]: /terraform/docs/glossary#terraform-provider

A plugin for Terraform that makes a collection of related resources available. A provider plugin is responsible for understanding [API][] interactions with some kind of service and exposing [resources][] based on that API.

Terraform providers are generally tied to a specific _infrastructure provider,_ which might be an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) provider (like AWS, GCP, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack), a platform as a service (PaaS) provider (like Heroku), or a software as a service (SaaS) provider (like HCP Terraform, DNSimple, Cloudflare).

There are many existing providers available, but providers can also be custom-built to work with any API.

## Pull Request (PR)

[pull request]: /terraform/docs/glossary#pull-request-pr-
[pull requests]: /terraform/docs/glossary#pull-request-pr-
[pr]: /terraform/docs/glossary#pull-request-pr-
[prs]: /terraform/docs/glossary#pull-request-pr-

A mechanism created by GitHub to review and discuss changes made to a [Git][] [repository][] [branch][] that a user wants to merge into another branch. Other collaborators can request changes, approve, or reject these changes.

Conversationally, people often say "pull request" to refer to this review-before-merging workflow even when working with a VCS provider that calls it something else. (For example, GitLab calls this a Merge Request.)

## Queue

[queue]: /terraform/docs/glossary#queue
[queues]: /terraform/docs/glossary#queue

### HCP Terraform

The list of [runs][] waiting to be processed. HCP Terraform uses several queues of runs, including a per-workspace queue (since only one run at a time is allowed in a given [workspace][], to avoid conflicts and state corruption) and a global per-instance queue (since compute resources are finite and HCP Terraform only has access to so many VMs).

## (Terraform) Registry

[terraform registry]: /terraform/docs/glossary#terraform-registry
[registry]: /terraform/docs/glossary#terraform-registry

A repository of [modules][] written by the Terraform community, which can be used as-is within a Terraform [configuration][] or [forked][] and modified. The registry can help you get started with Terraform more quickly, see examples of how Terraform is written, and find pre-made modules for infrastructure components you require.

- [Terraform docs: The Terraform Registry](/terraform/registry)

## Remote Operations

[remote operation]: /terraform/docs/glossary#remote-operations
[remote operations]: /terraform/docs/glossary#remote-operations

### HCP Terraform

The ability to start a [run][] (or perform a few other tasks) from your local [CLI][] and view output inline, while still allowing HCP Terraform to perform the actual operation.

HCP Terraform performs Terraform runs in its own disposable VMs, where it can capture information, control access to secrets, etc., but many users are accustomed to running Terraform on their local machines. Remote operations exist to help split the difference.

- [HCP Terraform Docs: Terraform Runs and Remote Operations](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations#remote-operations)

## Remote Backend

[remote backend]: /terraform/docs/glossary#remote-backend

A Terraform CLI feature that lets Terraform connect to HCP Terraform, by specifying in the Terraform [configuration][] which organization and workspace(s) to use. Used for [remote operations][] in HCP Terraform workspaces, and used for [state][] storage in HCP Terraform's free edition.

See also [backend][]. Older documentation sometimes refers to backends like `s3` or `consul` as "remote backends," since they store Terraform's state in a remote service instead of the local filesystem, but today this term usually means the specific backend whose name is `remote`.

- [Terraform docs: The `remote` Backend](/terraform/language/settings/backends/remote)

## Repository

[repository]: /terraform/docs/glossary#repository
[repositories]: /terraform/docs/glossary#repository
[repo]: /terraform/docs/glossary#repository
[repos]: /terraform/docs/glossary#repository

Also "repo".

A collection of files and a history of the changes to them, managed by a [version control system][vcs]. In HCP Terraform, a "repo" is generally a Git repository that contains a Terraform configuration, although [private modules][] are also based on Git repos.

- [Wikipedia: Repository (version control)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)>)

## Resource

[resource]: /terraform/docs/glossary#resource
[resources]: /terraform/docs/glossary#resource

Also "infrastructure resource".

In Terraform's [configuration][] language: A [block][] that describes one or more infrastructure objects. Resources can be things like virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records.

In other Terraform-related contexts: An infrastructure object of a type that _could_ be managed by Terraform.

A resource block in a configuration instructs Terraform to _manage_ the described resource — during a run, Terraform will create a matching real infrastructure object if one doesn't already exist, and will modify the existing object if it doesn't match the desired configuration. Terraform uses [state][] to keep track of which real infrastructure objects correspond to resources in a configuration.

Terraform uses cloud provider [APIs][] to create, edit, and destroy resources. Terraform [providers][] are responsible for defining resource types and mapping transitions in a resource's state to a specific series of API calls that will carry out the necessary changes.

- [Terraform docs: Resources](/terraform/language/resources)

## Root Module

[root module]: /terraform/docs/glossary#root-module
[root modules]: /terraform/docs/glossary#root-module

The place where Terraform begins evaluating a [configuration][]. The root module consists of all of the configuration files in Terraform's [working directory][].

The root module's [variables][] and [outputs][] are handled directly by Terraform (unlike child [modules][], whose variables and outputs are handled by the calling module). Root variable values can be provided with HCP Terraform, `.tfvars` files, CLI options, or environment variables. Root outputs are printed after a run and stored in the state.

## Root Outputs

[root output]: /terraform/docs/glossary#root-outputs
[root outputs]: /terraform/docs/glossary#root-outputs

Also "root-level outputs".

The [output values][] of a configuration's [root module][]. A [configuration][] can access the root outputs of another configuration with a `terraform_remote_state` data source.

## Run

[run]: /terraform/docs/glossary#run
[runs]: /terraform/docs/glossary#run

Also "Terraform Run".

The process of using Terraform to make real infrastructure match the desired state (as specified by the contents of the config and variables at a specific moment in time).

In HCP Terraform, runs are performed in a series of stages ([plan][], [policy check][], and [apply][]), though not every stage occurs in every run. HCP Terraform saves information about historical runs.

- [Learn Terraform: Get Started](/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS)
- [HCP Terraform docs: About Runs](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations)

## Run Triggers

[run triggers]: /terraform/docs/glossary#run-triggers

### HCP Terraform

HCP Terraform provides a way to connect a given workspace to one or more workspaces within an organization, known as "source workspaces". These connections, called run triggers, allow runs to queue automatically in your workspace on successful apply of runs in any of the source workspaces.

- [HCP Terraform docs: Runs Triggers](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-triggers)

## S3

[s3]: /terraform/docs/glossary#s3

Amazon Web Services' "Simple Storage Service", a service for storing and retrieving arbitrary blobs of data.

Many other cloud or self-hosted services provide [APIs][] that are compatible with S3's API, which allows them to be used with software that was designed to work with S3.

Terraform's `aws` [provider][] can manage S3 resources.

Terraform Enterprise can use an S3-compatible [blob storage][] service when configured to use _External Services_ for storage.

- [AWS: S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

## SAML

[saml]: /terraform/docs/glossary#saml

-> Terraform Enterprise

SAML is an XML-based standard for authentication and authorization. Terraform Enterprise can act as a service provider (SP) (or Relying Party, RP) with your internal SAML identity provider (IdP). The SAML Single Sign On feature is only available on [Terraform Enterprise][]; the HCP Terraform SaaS does not support it.

- [Terraform Enterprise docs: SAML Single Sign-On](/terraform/enterprise/saml/configuration)

## Sentinel

[sentinel]: /terraform/docs/glossary#sentinel

### HCP Terraform

A language and runtime for managing policy as code. Allows you to define rules around operations in HCP Terraform.

- [HCP Terraform docs: Sentinel](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement)

## Site Admin

[site admin]: /terraform/docs/glossary#site-admin
[site admins]: /terraform/docs/glossary#site-admin

-> Terraform Enterprise

An administrator of a [Terraform Enterprise][] instance, who has access to application settings that affect all [organizations][] using the instance.

- [Terraform Enterprise docs: Administration](/terraform/enterprise/admin)

## Speculative Plan

[speculative plan]: /terraform/docs/glossary#speculative-plan
[speculative plans]: /terraform/docs/glossary#speculative-plan

### HCP Terraform

A [run][] that is only intended to show possible changes to infrastructure, when using a given [config version][] and set of [variables][]. Speculative plans can never be [applied][apply-v], and are usually started as a result of [pull requests][] to a [workspace][]'s repo, or by running `terraform plan` on the command line with [remote operations][] configured.

## SSH Key

[ssh key]: /terraform/docs/glossary#ssh-key
[ssh keys]: /terraform/docs/glossary#ssh-key

A type of access credential based on public key cryptography, used to log into servers.

HCP Terraform uses SSH private keys for two kinds of operations:

- Downloading private Terraform [modules][] with [Git][]-based sources during a Terraform run. Keys for downloading modules are assigned per-workspace.

- Bringing content from a connected [VCS provider][] into HCP Terraform, usually when pulling in a Terraform [configuration][] for a [workspace][] or importing a module into the [private module registry][]. Only some VCS providers require an SSH key, but other providers only need an SSH key if your repositories include submodules that are only accessible via SSH (instead of your VCS provider's API).

- [Wikipedia: SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)

- [HCP Terraform docs: SSH Keys for Cloning Modules](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/ssh-keys)

## State

[state]: /terraform/docs/glossary#state

Terraform's cached information about your managed infrastructure and [configuration][]. This state is used to persistently map the same real world [resources][] to your configuration from run-to-run, keep track of metadata, and improve performance for large infrastructures.

Without state, Terraform has no way to identify the real resources it created during previous runs. Thus, when multiple people are collaborating on shared infrastructure, it's important to store state in a shared location, like a free HCP Terraform organization.

- [Terraform docs: State](/terraform/language/state)

## State Version

[state version]: /terraform/docs/glossary#state-version
[state versions]: /terraform/docs/glossary#state-version

### HCP Terraform

A snapshot of your infrastructure's [state][] at a point in time. Can be manually uploaded to HCP Terraform or created as the result of an [apply][].

Terraform CLI doesn't have any concept of historical state data; it only interacts with the most recent state, and writes a snapshot of the new state to the configured [backend][] after making changes. Whatever system that backend writes to can choose to retain previous state; HCP Terraform does this, and some other backends (like S3) can also be configured to keep historical snapshots. The `local` backend does not.

## Team

[team]: /terraform/docs/glossary#team
[teams]: /terraform/docs/glossary#team

### HCP Terraform

A group of HCP Terraform users, which can be given permission to access and/or edit various objects ([workspaces][], [policies][], etc.) within an [organization][]. A team belongs to a single organization. Users can belong to any number of teams in any number of organizations.

- [HCP Terraform docs: Teams](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams)

## Terraform

[terraform]: /terraform/docs/glossary#terraform

A tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

- [Intro to Terraform](/terraform/intro)

## HCP Terraform

[hcp terraform]: /terraform/docs/glossary#hcp-terraform

An application that helps teams use Terraform together. HCP Terraform provides a consistent environment for Terraform runs, as well as hosting Terraform [state][] and other shared information.

HCP Terraform is available as a hosted service at <https://app.terraform.io>. It is also available in an on-premises distribution called [Terraform Enterprise][].

Prior to 2024, HCP Terraform was previously refered to as "Terraform Cloud". Prior to 2019, "Terraform Enterprise" (TFE) was the name of Terraform's cloud application (now HCP Terraform), and "Private Terraform Enterprise" (PTFE) was the name of the on-premises distribution.

- [HCP Terraform docs](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform)

## Terraform Enterprise

[terraform enterprise]: /terraform/docs/glossary#terraform-enterprise

An on-premises distribution of HCP Terraform, which enables large enterprises to host their own private instance of the application.

Prior to 2019, "Terraform Enterprise" (TFE) was the name of Terraform's cloud application (now HCP Terraform), and "Private Terraform Enterprise" (PTFE) was the name of the on-premises distribution. Prior to 2024, HCP Terraform was previously refered to as "Terraform Cloud". 

- [Terraform Enterprise docs](/terraform/enterprise)

## Terraform Version

[terraform version]: /terraform/docs/glossary#tool-version
[terraform versions]: /terraform/docs/glossary#tool-version

### HCP Terraform

A particular version of the `terraform` binary available for use in HCP Terraform workspaces. Specifies a URL, a SHA256 checksum and enabled/beta flags.

[Site admins][] can configure the available Terraform versions for a [Terraform Enterprise][] instance.

- [Terraform Enterprise docs: Managing Terraform Versions](/terraform/enterprise/admin/application/resources#managing-terraform-versions)

## TFE

[tfe]: /terraform/docs/glossary#tfe

[Terraform Enterprise][].

- [Terraform Enterprise docs](/terraform/enterprise)

## TFE Provider / HCP Terraform Provider

[tfe provider]: /terraform/docs/glossary#tfe-provider-hcp-terraform-provider

A Terraform provider that manages HCP Terraform. Allows you to manage HCP Terraform using a Terraform [configuration][].

- [Provider docs: tfe](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs)

## (API) Token

[token]: /terraform/docs/glossary#api-token
[tokens]: /terraform/docs/glossary#api-token

### HCP Terraform

A revocable secret string that authenticates a user, to allow use of HCP Terraform's [API][] or the [remote backend][].

Different kinds of tokens grant different permissions. Tokens can be granted by user, [team][], or [organization][].

Many applications other than HCP Terraform use token-based authentication, but within HCP Terraform's documentation and UI, "token" without any other qualification generally means an HCP Terraform API token.

- [HCP Terraform docs: User Tokens](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#api-tokens)
- [HCP Terraform docs: Team Tokens](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams#api-tokens)
- [HCP Terraform docs: Organization Tokens](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#api-tokens)

## Trigger

[trigger]: /terraform/docs/glossary#trigger
[triggers]: /terraform/docs/glossary#trigger

### HCP Terraform

Something that causes a new [run][] to queue. Runs can be UI/VCS-driven (in which case the trigger is a new VCS commit or a UI action), API-driven (in which case the trigger is an API call) or CLI-driven (in which case the trigger is a CLI command).

- [HCP Terraform docs: UI/VCS-based Run Workflow](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/ui)

## Variables

[variables]: /terraform/docs/glossary#variables
[input variables]: /terraform/docs/glossary#variables

Also "input variables".

In general-purpose programming, a variable is a symbolic name associated with a value.

In Terraform, "variables" almost always refers to _input variables,_ which are key/value pairs used in a [run][]. Terraform [modules][] can declare variables to allow customization. For child modules, the parent module provides a value when calling the module; for the [root module][], values are provided at run time.

HCP Terraform lets you set values for root input variables in a [workspace][], so all collaborators can use the same values. Variable values marked as "sensitive" become unreadable in the UI and API, and all variable values are protected by Vault.

- [Terraform docs: Input Variables](/terraform/language/values/variables)
- [HCP Terraform docs: Variables](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables)

## VCS

[vcs]: /terraform/docs/glossary#vcs

Version Control System, like [Git][]. Software that tracks changes over time to a collection of files, making it possible to keep track of changes, undo changes, and combine changes made in parallel by different users. Usually used for any non-trivial code effort, including infrastructure as code.

Different VCSes use different models for history; Git models changes as a directed acyclic graph of [commits][], and parallel changes that begin from the same parent commit become diverging [branches][] (which might later be merged together).

- [Wikipedia: Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)

## VCS Provider

[vcs provider]: /terraform/docs/glossary#vcs-provider
[vcs providers]: /terraform/docs/glossary#vcs-provider

### HCP Terraform

A specific service that provides [VCS][] features, with the goal of enabling teams to collaborate on code. HCP Terraform can integrate with VCS providers to access your Terraform [configurations][] and [modules][], and currently supports GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab.com, GitLab EE and CE, Bitbucket Cloud, Bitbucket Data Center, Azure DevOps Server, and Azure DevOps Services.

- [HCP Terraform docs: Connecting VCS Providers](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs)

## Webhook

[webhook]: /terraform/docs/glossary#webhook
[webhooks]: /terraform/docs/glossary#webhook

A server-to-server HTTP request, in which one system responds to a change in its internal state by sending information to another system.

The recipient of a webhook might return information to the requesting system, call other webhooks in response, perform its action silently, or ignore the request entirely.

HCP Terraform uses webhooks in multiple ways. Most notably:

- HCP Terraform creates webhook configurations on [VCS providers][], so that they send webhook requests to HCP Terraform whenever linked [repositories][] receive [pull requests][] or new [commits][]. ([HCP Terraform docs: UI/VCS-driven Runs](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/ui))
- Users can create webhook configurations on HCP Terraform [workspaces][], so that HCP Terraform will send run notification webhooks to Slack or other external services. ([HCP Terraform docs: Run Notifications](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/notifications))

## Working Directory

[working directory]: /terraform/docs/glossary#working-directory
[working directories]: /terraform/docs/glossary#working-directory

The directory where `terraform init` runs, creating a `.terraform` subdirectory. All subsequent commands for the same [configuration][] should then be run from the same working directory.

The [root module][] consists of all of the configuration files in the top level of Terraform's working directory. Subdirectories of the working directory can contain child [modules][].

## Workspace

[workspace]: /terraform/docs/glossary#workspace
[workspaces]: /terraform/docs/glossary#workspace

In Terraform CLI, a workspace is an isolated instance of [state][] data. Using multiple workspaces lets you manage multiple non-overlapping sets of infrastructure from a single [configuration][] in a single [working directory][].

In HCP Terraform, a workspace is a complex object that represents everything needed to manage a specific collection of infrastructure resources over time. In particular, this includes:

- A Terraform [configuration][] (which has multiple versions over time, and which can come from a repo or from manual uploads)
- A set of [variables][]
- [State][] data that represents the current and historical condition of the infrastructure
- Historical information about [runs][].

All HCP Terraform runs occur in the context of a workspace — they use that workspace's config data, use that workspace's state to identify the real infrastructure being managed, and edit that workspace's state to match any infrastructure changes during the run. A workspace belongs to an [organization][].

- [HCP Terraform docs: Workspaces](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces)
- [Terraform docs: Workspaces](/terraform/language/state/workspaces)
