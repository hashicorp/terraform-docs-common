# Terraform overview

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This includes both low-level components like compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

### Get Started

- Learn how Terraform [solves infrastructure challenges](/terraform/intro) and how it [compares to other tools and services](/terraform/intro/vs).
- Install Terraform and explore use cases with the [hands-on tutorials](/terraform/tutorials).

### Manage Infrastructure

- Describe infrastructure on various [providers](/terraform/language/providers) with [Terraform's configuration language](/terraform/language).
- Use the [Terraform CLI](/terraform/cli) to manage configuration, plugins, infrastructure, and state.
- Use [CDK for Terraform](/terraform/cdktf) to write and deploy Terraform configurations in your preferred programming language.

### Collaborate

- [HCP Terraform](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) helps teams use Terraform together, with version control, state sharing, [governance](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement), and more.
- [Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise) is a self-hosted instance of HCP Terraform.

### Develop and Share

- [Create a provider](/terraform/plugin) to allow Terraform to interact with a service.
- Create reusable configurations with [modules](/terraform/language/modules).
- [Publish a provider or module](/terraform/registry) to the Terraform Registry to make it publicly available.
