# Terraform Tools
Terraform is part of a rich infrastructure and DevOps ecosystem. The tools below extend Terraformâ€™s functionality or pair with Terraform to solve a broad range of infrastructure challenges.

## Develop and Validate Configuration

|Name | Maintainer |Description| Tutorial |
|-----|------------|-----------|----------|
|[Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF)](/terraform/cdktf)| HashiCorp | Use familiar programming languages to define and provision infrastructure. CDKTF currently supports TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go (experimental).| [Write CDK for Terraform configurations](/terraform/tutorials/cdktf) |
|[Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform) | HashiCorp | Enable syntax highlighting and other editing features in VS Code using the Terraform Language Server.| |
|[Language Server](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls) | HashiCorp | Add support for the Terraform configuration language to editors that use the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), like Sublime Text, vim, emacs, etc.| |
|[console](/terraform/cli/commands/console) | HashiCorp | Evaluate Terraform expressions and explore your Terraform project's state. The console helps you develop and debug your configuration, especially when working with complex state data and Terraform expressions.| [Develop Configuration with the Console](/terraform/tutorials/cli/console) |


## Manage Infrastructure

|Name | Maintainer |Description| Tutorial |
|-----|------------|-----------|----------|
|[Kubernetes Operator for Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-k8s)| HashiCorp | Manage cloud and on-prem infrastructure through a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) and HCP Terraform. | [Deploy Infrastructure with the Terraform Cloud Operator for Kubernetes](/terraform/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-operator) |
| [ServiceNow Catalog](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now) | HashiCorp |  Create Terraform configuration to order Service Items, create workspaces, and perform Terraform runs from ServiceNow.| |
| [Consul Terraform Sync (CTS)](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync) | HashiCorp | Automatically request network infrastructure updates to accommodate Consul service registrations. Works with A10 ADC, F5 BIG IP, Palo Alto Networks, and more. | [Network Infrastructure Automation (NIA)](/consul/tutorials/network-infrastructure-automation)  |


## Automate Terraform

|Name | Maintainer |Description| Tutorial |
|-----|------------|-----------|----------|
| [`terraform-exec`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec) | HashiCorp | Use this Go module to construct and run CLI commands. Refer to the `terraform-json` repository (below) for documentation about the return values. |  |
| [`terraform-json`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-json) | HashiCorp | Use the data types and helper functions in this repository to work with JSON-formatted Terraform output.|  |
|[TFE Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest) | HashiCorp | Manage HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise with Terraform itself. Create, modify, and delete organizations, workspaces, teams, variables, run triggers, policy sets, and more. |  |
| [CircleCI Orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/terraform) | Third Party | Deploy your Terraform infrastructure with a CircleCI pipeline. CircleCI Orbs let you package, ship, and re-use configurations. | [Deploy Terraform infrastructure with CircleCI](/terraform/tutorials/automation/circle-ci) |
|[GitHub Actions for Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform) | Third Party | Automate Terraform in your GitHub Actions workflow. After you have used the action, subsequent steps in the same job can run Terraform commands using the GitHub Actions run syntax. | [Automate Terraform with GitHub Actions](/terraform/tutorials/automation/github-actions) |

## Security and Compliance

|Name | Maintainer |Description| Tutorial |
|-----|------------|-----------|----------|
| [Splunk and HCP Terraform](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/splunk) | HashiCorp | Pull audit logs from HCP Terraform into Splunk to identify the most active policies, understand significant changes in resource operations, and filter actions by specific users within your organization. | |
| [Sentinel](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement) | HashiCorp |  Write and enforce fine-grained, logic-based policies for your infrastructure. Sentinel is an embedded policy-as-code framework integrated with the HashiCorp Enterprise products. | [Enforce Policy with Sentinel](/terraform/tutorials/policy) |


## Develop Terraform Providers

|Name | Maintainer |Description| Tutorial |
|-----|------------|-----------|----------|
|[Plugin Framework](/terraform/plugin/framework) | HashiCorp | A new SDK to develop your own Terraform providers. The framework provides improvements and additional features beyond what is available in the Plugin SDK. | [Implement a Provider with the Terraform Plugin Framework](/terraform/tutorials/providers-plugin-framework/providers-plugin-framework-provider) |
|[`terraform-plugin-testing`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing)| HashiCorp | is a module for testing Terraform providers using real configurations to simulate the plan, apply, refresh, and destroy life cycles. | |
|[`terraform-plugin-mux`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-mux)| HashiCorp | Combine providers built using different SDKs and frameworks. This lets you upgrade between SDKs or frameworks on a resource-by-resource basis instead of all at once. | |
| [`terraform-plugin-log`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log) | HashiCorp | Attach context and information to logs and use multiple loggers to filter log output. | |
| [`ghaction-terraform-provider-release`](https://github.com/hashicorp/ghaction-terraform-provider-release) | HashiCorp | GitHub Action Workflows for releasing Terraform Providers to the public Registry. | |
