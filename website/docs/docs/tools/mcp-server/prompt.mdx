# Prompt a model connected to the Terraform MCP server 

This topic provides example prompts for helping you write Terraform configuration after installing the Terraform model context protocol (MCP) server. Refer to [Deploy the Terraform MCP server](/terraform/docs/tools/mcp-server/install) for instructions on how to deploy the server.

@include 'beta.mdx'

## Overview

To trigger the MCP server tools, ask your LLM questions about your provider configuration or general questions about Terraform providers and modules. Note that for your LLM to use the server, your questions must pertain to provider configuration from the registry. The LLM uses other sources, such as content from the internet, to respond to general questions about Terraform configuration or requests to generate code.  

## Requirements

Verify that you have deployed the Terraform MCP server and configured your client. Refer to [Deploy the Terraform MCP server](/terraform/docs/tools/mcp-server/deploy) for instructions.

## Prompt your MCP client

Your model may still decide to use other resources to formulate responses, but you can use the following guidelines to help you create prompts that are more likely to be routed through the server:
 
- Include the names of specific providers or provider modules. For example, use `google_compute_disk` in your prompt instead of `the compute disk`.
- Use the full Terraform resource address in your query. Refer to [Resource Address Reference](/terraform/cli/state/resource-addressing) in the Terraform CLI documentation for additional information about resource addresses.
- Ask for the latest information about the provider or module.

## Examples     

You can use the following set of prompts as a guide to help you write your own configuration. The following responses are returned from the server using ChatGPT 4.1 in GitHub Copilot on VS Code. Your responses may vary.

### Get AI-related resources from the Google provider

The following prompt runs the [`resolveProviderDocID`](/terraform/docs/tools/mcp-server#resolveproviderdocid) tool, which obtains a list of related provider document IDs so that you can decide which resources to create:

> "I need help understanding what resources are available in the Google provider that are for AI"


#### Response

The server sends the following request payload to the registry: 

```json
   {
      "providerDataType": "resources",
      "providerName": "google",
      "providerNamespace": "hashicorp",
      "providerVersion": "latest",
      "serviceSlug": "ai"
}
```

The server retrieves the following response from the registry. The response is truncated in this example:

```markdown
Available Documentation (top matches) for resources in Terraform provider hashicorp/google version: 6.35.0

Each result includes:
- providerDocID: tfprovider-compatible identifier
- Title: Service or resource name
- Category: Type of document
For best results, select libraries based on the serviceSlug match and category of information requested.

---
- providerDocID: 8925589
- Title: vertex_ai_endpoint_iam
- Category: resources
---
- providerDocID: 8925590
- Title: vertex_ai_feature_group
- Category: resources
---
- providerDocID: 8925591
- Title: vertex_ai_feature_group_feature
- Category: resources

. . .
```

The client prints the following response using the context acquired from the MCP server:

> The Google Terraform provider offers several resources related to AI, primarily under the Vertex AI and Document AI services. Here are the main AI-related resources available:
>
> **Vertex AI Resources**
>
>   - `vertex_ai_dataset`
>   - `vertex_ai_deployment_resource_pool`
>   - `vertex_ai_endpoint`
>   - `vertex_ai_endpoint_iam`
>   - `vertex_ai_feature_group`
>   - `vertex_ai_featurestore`
>   - `vertex_ai_index`
>   - `vertex_ai_metadata_store`
>   - `vertex_ai_tensorboard`
>   - `document_ai_processor`
>   - `document_ai_warehouse_document_schema`
> 
> These resources allow you to manage datasets, endpoints, feature stores, indexes, metadata, and more for AI/ML workflows on Google Cloud, as well as Document AI processors and schemas.
>
> If you want details or documentation for any specific resource, let me know which one(s) you're interested in!

### Get information about storage buckets in Azure

The following prompt runs the [`resolveProviderDocID`](/terraform/docs/tools/mcp-server#resolveproviderdocid) tool, which gets a list of provider documentation IDs. Next, the [`getProviderDocs`](/terraform/docs/tools/mcp-server#getproviderdocs) tool calls the appropriate documentation for the use case:

> "I need help setting up storage buckets in the azure provider"

#### Response

The server sends a request payload for each tool: 

<CodeBlockConfig heading="resolveProviderDocId">

```json
{
  "providerDataType": "resources",
  "providerName": "azurerm",
  "providerNamespace": "hashicorp",
  "providerVersion": "latest",

```
