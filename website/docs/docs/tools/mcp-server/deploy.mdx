# Deploy the Terraform MCP server

This topic describes how to deploy the Terraform model context protocol (MCP) server in a Docker container on your local workstation. The Terraform MCP server connects to a client so that your LLM can use data stored in the Terraform registry to help you write Terraform configuration. Refer to the [overview](/terraform/docs/terraform-tools/mcp-server) for additional information about the Terraform MCP server.

@include 'beta.mdx'

## Overview

Complete the following steps to deploy the Terraform MCP server:

1. Pull the Docker image 
1. Connect your client to the MCP server
1. Configure your client

## Requirements

One of the following Docker distributions is required:

- Docker Engine v20.10.21+
- Docker Desktop v4.14.0+

Refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop) for installation instructions.

The following MCP clients are supported:

- VS Code with CoPilot. Refer to the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) for installation instructions.
- Cursor. Refer to the [Cursor website](https://www.cursor.com) for more information.
- Anthropic Claude Desktop. Refer to the [Anthropic Claude Desktop documentation](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10065433-installing-claude-for-desktop) for installation instructions.

## Enable MCP in your client

Refer to your client's documentation for instructions on enabling MCP:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)
- [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuring-mcp-servers)
- [Anthropic Claude Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

## Install the server

For VS Code, create an `mcp.json` file in the `.vscode` or `.cursor` directory of your local workspace and add the following configuration: 

```json
{
"servers": {
   "terraform-mcp-server": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
         "run",
         "-i",
         "--rm",
         "hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server:0.1.0"
      ]
   }
}
}
```

For Claude Desktop MCP clients, create an `mcp.json` file and add the following configuration: 

   ```json
   {
   "mcpServers": {
     "servers": {
      "hcp-terraform": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
           "run",
           "-i",
           "--rm",
           "hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server:0.1.0"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
   }
   ```


## Configure your MCP client

Complete the following steps if you are using Copilot in VS Code: 

1. Open the chat interface and choose **Agent** from the mode settings. 
1. Click the tools icon to verify that the Terraform MCP server tools are enabled.

Complete the following steps if you are using Cursor:

1. Open the chat pane and choose **Chat Settings** from the ellipses menu. 
1. Choose **Agent from the **Default new chat mode** drop-down menu.
1. Choose **MCP** from the **Cursor Settings** sidebar to verify that the Terraform MCP server tools are enabled.

Complete the following steps if you are using Claude Desktop:

1. Open the chat pane and choose the **search and tools** slider icon to the bottom left of the chat pane.
1. Click **terraform-mcp-server** to verify that all the tools are enabled.

## Next steps

After downloading the Terraform MCP server and connecting it to your client, you can begin prompting your model about your Terraform configuration code. Refer to [Prompt an AI model](/terraform/docs/tools/mcp-server/prompt) for more information.
