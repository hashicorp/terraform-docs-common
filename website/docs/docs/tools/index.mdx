CircleCI Orbs let you package, ship, and re-use configurations. | [Deploy Terraform infrastructure with CircleCI](/terraform/tutorials/automation/circle-ci) |
|[GitHub Actions for Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform) | Third Party | Automate Terraform in your GitHub Actions workflow. After you have used the action, subsequent steps in the same job can run Terraform commands using the GitHub Actions run syntax. | [Automate Terraform with GitHub Actions](/terraform/tutorials/automation/github-actions) |

## Security and Compliance

|Name | Maintainer |Description| Tutorial |
|-----|------------|-----------|----------|
| [Splunk and HCP Terraform](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/splunk) | HashiCorp | Pull audit logs from HCP Terraform into Splunk to identify the most active policies, understand significant changes in resource operations, and filter actions by specific users within your organization. | |
