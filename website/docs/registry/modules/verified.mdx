# Partner Modules

Partner modules are published by tech and cloud organizations that have a partnership agreement with HashiCorp. Partner contributors actively maintain their modules to stay up-to-date and compatible with both Terraform and their respective providers.

The partner badge appears next to modules that are published by a partner.

Partner modules are expected to be actively maintained by HashiCorp partners.
The partner badge isnâ€™t indicative of flexibility or feature support; very
simple modules can have the badge just because they're great examples of modules.
Likewise, an non-partner module could be extremely high quality and actively
maintained. An non-partner module shouldn't be assumed to be poor quality, it
only means it hasn't been created by a HashiCorp partner.

When [using registry modules](/terraform/registry/modules/use), there is no
difference between a partner and non-partner module; they are used the same
way.
