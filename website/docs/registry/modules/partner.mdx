# Partner Modules

Partner modules are reviewed by HashiCorp and actively maintained by contributors to stay up-to-date and compatible with both Terraform and their respective providers.

The partner badge appears next to modules that are published by a partner source.

Partner modules are expected to be actively maintained by HashiCorp partners.
The partner badge isnâ€™t indicative of a module's flexibility or feature support. We can mark simple modules as partnet modules because they are great module examples.
Likewise, an non-partner module could be extremely high quality and actively
maintained. An non-partner module shouldn't be assumed to be poor quality, it
only means it hasn't been created by a HashiCorp partner.

When [using registry modules](/terraform/registry/modules/use), there is no
difference between a partner and non-partner module, you can use them the same
way.
