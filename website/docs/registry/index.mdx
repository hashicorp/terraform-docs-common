# Terraform Registry Publishing

The [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io) is an interactive resource for discovering a wide selection of integrations (providers), configuration packages (modules), and security rules (policies) for use with Terraform. The Registry includes solutions developed by HashiCorp, third-party vendors, and our Terraform community. Our goal with the Registry is to provide plugins to manage any infrastructure API, pre-made modules to quickly configure common infrastructure components, and examples of how to write quality Terraform code.

The Terraform Registry is integrated [directly into Terraform](/language/providers/requirements) so you can directly specify providers and modules. Anyone can publish and consume providers, modules, and policies on the public [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io). To publish private modules within your organization, you can use a [private registry](/registry/private) or [reference repositories and other sources directly](/language/modules/sources).

Use the navigation to the left to learn more about using the Terraform Registry.

## Navigating the Registry

The registry has a number of different categories for modules, providers, and policies to help with navigating the large number of available options. Select a provider or module card to learn more, filter results to a [specific tier](/registry/providers#provider-tiers-amp-namespaces), or use the search field at the top of the Registry. Search supports keyboard navigation.
