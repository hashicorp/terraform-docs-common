## Common publishing issues

### How can I fix a formatting issue in the documentation for my provider?

If you have issues formatting documentation, use the [documentation preview tool](https://registry.terraform.io/tools/doc-preview) to view how the Terraform Registry will format your documentation before you commit to a new provider release. [Learn more about creating provider documentation](/terraform/registry/providers/docs).

If you have already released a version of your provider and are unhappy with its documentation, [fix the documentation issue in your repository and include it in a new release](#how-can-I-correct-a-bug-typo-or-documentation-error-in-a-version-of-my-provider-module-or-policy-library-once-it-has-been-published).

### How do I remove a version of my provider, module, or policy library that has already been published?

If any users have already begun using a version of your provider, module, or policy library, removing the version from the Terraform Registry will break their Terraform configuration. They may be unable to work with their infrastructure until they can find a suitable replacement version of your integration. For this reason, **we recommend that you never remove previously published versions of providers, modules, or policy libraries**.

There are a few situations where you may need to remove a version from the Terraform Registry. For example, if a version has a critical security vulnerability.

In these situations, your options for removing previously published versions vary on the type of integration:

- **Modules**: The module owner can use the Terraform Registry to [remove a specific version, all versions of a specific module provider, or the module entirely](/terraform/registry/modules/publish#removing-published-content).
- **Providers**: There is no manual process for removing a version of a provider. [Reach out to us via email](/terraform/registry#getting-help) if it is critical that a version be deleted.
- **Policy Libraries**: The owner of a policy library can completely [remove it from the Registry through the website](/terraform/registry/policy-libraries/publishing#removing-a-policy-library).

### How can I correct a bug, typo, or documentation error in a version of my provider, module, or policy library once it has been published?

If there is a problem with a specific version, publish a new release with the issue fixed. Increment the patch version according to [standard Semantic Versioning practices](https://semver.org/#spec-item-6) (e.g., from `1.2.0` to `1.2.1`).

### Can I remove a version of a provider, module, or policy library by deleting the release or tag from GitHub?

**We recommend you never remove content from a GitHub repository that has already been published to the Terraform Registry**.

The Terraform Registry effectively acts as an index for Terraform-related content hosted on GitHub. When you make a new tag or release in the GitHub repository that holds your Terraform integration, the Registry automatically creates an index record for that content. Think of an index record as a pointer to those files in your GitHub repository.

The Terraform Registry is unaware if you remove a file, a tag, a release, or other content from GitHub. The Registry could still host index records pointing to now-removed content. As a result, someone using your provider or module may have their Terraform configuration break because the Registry is referencing GitHub files that are no longer available.

If you find a typo, bug, or other issues with a published version of your provider, module, or policy library, [we recommend fixing the problem and publishing a new release](#how-can-i-correct-a-bug-or-typo-in-a-version-of-my-provider-module-or-policy-library-once-it-has-been-published).

### I have moved the GitHub repository that hosts my provider, module, or policy library to a new GitHub user or organization. How can I update my integration in the Registry?

Once your integration begins to be used by consumers, it is important that the name of the integration remains constant. Otherwise, the Terraform configuration that consumers wrote may become invalid.

For this reason, we strongly encourage you not to try to ever move or rename an existing integration. Instead, its often a better choice to create a new repository, representing the new name of your integration, while leaving the old content in the same place.

For further help, [reach out to us via email](/terraform/registry#getting-help).

### I have renamed the GitHub user or organization that owns my provider, module, or policy library's GitHub repository. How can I update my integration in the Registry?

When you change the name of a GitHub user or organization, GitHub redirects requests directed at the old user or organization name to the new one. This means that your Registry integration will continue to work using the same, old name that your integration's consumers are used to adding to their Terraform configuration files.

This is usually the desired outcome, because your integration continues to work like your consumers expect it to. If you need to change the name of your integration, [see the previous question above](#i-have-moved-the-github-repository-that-hosts-my-provider-module-or-policy-library-to-a-new-github-user-or-organization-how-can-i-update-my-integration-in-the-registry).

In either case, **we strongly encourage you to reclaim the GitHub username that you moved away from**. If someone else claims your old user or organization name, they could build repositories that "capture" redirected requests from the Registry. At this point, your consumers would be unable to download your integration.

### I no longer have access to the GitHub user that I used to publish a provider, module, or policy library. How can I regain ownership of my integration in the Registry?

Please [reach out to us via email](/terraform/registry#getting-help) for support.

### What does it mean to "resync" my provider, module, or policy library?

Owners of any of these types of Terraform integrations can find a "resync" button on the webpage for the integrations they own. Triggering a resync instructs the Registry to analyze the integration's source repository on GitHub. During a resync, the registry will:

- Make sure that there is a webhook established on the repository, so that new versions of the integration can be automatically published.
- Look for any discrepancies between the versions of the integration that exist in the GitHub repository and those that exist in the Registry.

If there are new versions available in GitHub that have not been published in the Registry, those new versions will be published.

If there are versions that have been published in the Registry that no longer exist in GitHub, resync behavior diverges depending on the type of integration:

- For modules, versions that are available in the Registry but no longer available in GitHub will be removed from the Registry. This may confuse any consumers who have come to rely on these versions of your module.

- For providers and policy libraries, published versions in the Registry are not removed, even if they no longer exist in GitHub. This state can cause certain versions of the integrations to be unusable. [We recommend that you never delete files, tags, or releases from GitHub once they've been published to the Registry](#can-i-remove-a-version-of-a-provider-module-or-policy-library-by-deleting-the-release-or-tag-from-github).

Please note that the resync procedure will not remove or update versions of the integration that have already been published.

### I created a new version of my provider, module, or policy library on GitHub and it didn't show up in the Registry. What should I do?

The first thing to try is to [resync your integration with Github](#what-does-it-mean-to-resync-my-provider-module-or-policy-library). While logged in to the Registry, browse to the page for your integration. You can find a button to resync in the "Manage Module" or "Manage Policy Library" dropdown menus for those types of assets, or in the "Settings" tab for a Terraform provider.

If that doesn't work, or if publishing problems occur again _after_ you've done a resync, you should investigate the webhooks that have been established on your GitHub repository. You can locate these webhooks in your repository's settings page:

```
https://github.com/{your github username}/{your repository name}/settings/hooks
```

If there are multiple webhooks listed that point to the Registry's URL (`https://registry.terraform.io`), you should remove them all, and then try to resync your integration again using the above instructions.

Finally, if you're still running into trouble, please [reach out to us via email](/terraform/registry#getting-help) for support. If you are a customer of HashiCorp, work with your enterprise support contact to escalate the issue.

### How does the Registry identify the latest version of my provider, module, or policy library?

Each version of an integration published in the Terraform Registry has a version identifier, which is a string like `1.2.3`. You create the version identifier when you create a tag (for modules and policy libraries) or a release (for providers) in the GitHub repository where the integration's code lives.

The Registry requires that these version identifiers are [SemVer compliant](https://semver.org/). Versions are sorted using these identifiers, following [standard SemVer rules for precedence](https://semver.org/#spec-item-11). The version identifier with the greatest precedence is always listed as latest by the Terraform Registry.

### Why are prerelease versions listed as the latest version of my provider, module, or policy library?

The Terraform Registry's version sorting is strictly SemVer compliant (see above). This means that "latest" in the Registry can be a prerelease version, if the prerelease's version identifier has the greatest precedence.

For example, if your provider has a published version 1 (i.e. `1.0.0`), and then you create a new release for a version 2 prerelease (e.g. `2.0.0-preview`), the version 2 prerelease will be listed as the latest version in the Terraform Registry.

Please note that terraform itself will never select a prerelease version during a `plan` or `apply`, unless the configuration files explicitly request one [using an exact version constraint](/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints#version-constraint-behavior).

### How do I change the GPG key that I use to sign my provider?

The public GPG keys that you upload to the registry serve two purposes:

1. When you publish a new version of a provider, the Registry can use this GPG key to verify the signature file you created. This lets the Registry confirm that the binary files were, in fact, compiled by you.
2. When someone download a version of your provider from the Registry, they can verify that the binary files that they download have not been tampered with since you built them and generated the signature file.

If you have previously used a certain GPG key to sign and publish providers, and you now wish to use a new one, you need only upload the new public GPG key, and use its private key to sign provider releases from now on.

You do not need to remove any old GPG keys. Leaving the old key in place allows consumers of old versions of your provider to continue using those versions.

### How do I remove a public GPG key from the Registry that has been used for publishing a provider?

Generally, you should not ever remove a public GPG key from the Registry. Because of this, we don't provide a way for you to do it yourself.

If you were to remove a public GPG key that has been used to sign previous versions of a provider, consumers would be unable to use those older versions, because they would be unable to verify the authenticity of the binary file they downloaded.

### My private GPG key and/or GitHub account was compromised in a security incident. How can I protect my Registry integrations?
