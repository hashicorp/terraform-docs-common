# Run Tasks
Terraform Cloud [run tasks](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) let you directly integrate third-party tools and services into Terraform runs. 

Each run task in a [workspace](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces) sends information to an external service at a specific run stage, such as after Terraform completes the plan. The external service processes the information and then sends a passed or failed status back to Terraform Cloud. Depending on the workspace’s configuration, failed run tasks can stop runs and prevent Terraform from provisioning infrastructure. 

For example, the [HCP Packer validation run task](/hcp/docs/packer/manage-image-use/terraform-cloud-run-tasks) checks the image artifacts within a Terraform configuration. The run task fails if the configuration references images marked as unusable.

## Finding Run Tasks in the Terraform Registry

Browse a list of all run tasks in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/run-tasks) or use keywords to search for run tasks relevant to your use cases.

## Adding a Run Task to the Terraform Registry

Adding a run task to the Terraform registry makes your run task available for other consumers and HashiCorp partners.

To add your run task to the Terraform registry:

1. Complete the [Technology Program Application](https://www.hashicorp.com/go/tech-partner).

1. Sign our Technology Partner Agreement to become a HashiCorp technology partner. HashiCorp sends you the agreement after you complete Technology Program Application.

1. Build and test your run task. 

This process requires choosing which stages of the Terraform run cycle you want your run task to support. For example, you may want to let users configure your run task to execute either before or after Terraform Cloud completes the plan. We also recommend thoroughly testing your run task in both passing and failing scenarios. Refer to [Run Tasks Integration](cloud-docs/api-docs/run-tasks/run-task-stages-and-results) for more information.

1. Provide a functional demonstration to a member of the HashiCorp Technology Alliances team. 

1. Create a publicly available documentation set for your run task with that includes the following details:
  - How to create a run task
  - How to attach the run task to a workspace
  - Which stages the run task supports
  - A showcase of the run task blocking and passing the build, preferably using screenshots

Once you complete all the requirements, the Technology Alliances team adds your run task to the Terraform Registry with a link to your public documentation set.
