# Using Policies from the Terraform Registry

Collections of Sentinel policies are available in the Terraform Registry as policy libraries. You can use these policies in both [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs) and the [Sentinel CLI](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/commands).

The Terraform Registry acts as a [remote source](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/configuration/remote-sources) for policies that you include in a standard [Sentinel configuration file](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/configuration).

## Finding Policies in the Terraform Registry

You can [browse policy libraries](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/policies) available on the Terraform Registry or [use keywords to search for policies](https://registry.terraform.io/search/policies) relevant to your use cases.

To view documentation for specific policies within a library:
1. Go to the policy library.
1. Click **Choose policies**. Available policies are listed in the bottom left of the window.
1. Click on the name of any policy library to see its documentation.

## Using Policies in Terraform Cloud or Sentinel CLI

You can use one or more policies from a policy library to create a Terraform Cloud [policy set](/cloud-docs/sentinel/manage-policies#policies-and-policy-sets). You can also use policies directly with the [Sentinel CLI](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel). The Terraform Registry autogenerates the HCL code you need to configure each policy.

To get the HCL configuration code for one or more policies:

1. Go to the policy library and click **Choose policies**.
1. Select the policies you want to use in the bottom left of the window. The Terraform Registry populates HCL code in the **Usage Instructions** field.
1. Click **Copy Code Snippet** to copy the HCL code to your clipboard.
1. Paste the HCL code into a [Sentinel configuration file](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/configuration) file or [Terraform Cloud `sentinel.hcl` file](/cloud-docs/sentinel/manage-policies#the-sentinel-hcl-configuration-file).

### Terraform Cloud

We recommend defining all of the policies for a Terraform Cloud workspace in a single `sentinel.hcl` file. You may wish to change the [enforcement level](/cloud-docs/sentinel/manage-policies#enforcement-levels) in the autogenerated HCL code snippets. By default, this is set to `advisory`.

After you add the configuration code to your `sentinel.hcl` file, [create a new policy set in Terraform Cloud](/cloud-docs/sentinel/manage-policies#managing-policy-sets) and apply it to one or more workspaces.
