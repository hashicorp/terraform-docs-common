# Viewing and Managing Runs

Each workspace in Terraform Cloud includes a list of its current, pending, and historical runs. You can view and interact with these runs in the UI. You can also lock workspaces to temporarily prevent new runs.

## API

Refer to the [Runs API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/run) and [lock a Workspace endpoint](/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#lock-a-workspace).

## Navigating Runs

Go to the **Runs** tab in the workspace to review a list of all Terrform runs associated with the workspace.

### The Run Page

Click a run to go to its details page. The details page contains the following information:

- The current status of the run.
- The code commit associated with the run.
- How the run was initiated, when, and which user initiated it (if applicable).
- A timeline of events related to the run.
- The output from both the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands, if applicable. This output defaults to visible if the command is currently running, and hidden if the command has finished.

## Interacting with Runs

In workspaces where you have permission to apply runs, run pages include controls for interacting with the run at the bottom of the page. Refer to [Permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions) for details.

The following options are available, depending on the state of the run:

| Button              | Available when:                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Confirm & Apply     | A plan needs confirmation.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Override & Continue | A soft-mandatory policy failed. Requires permission to manage policy overrides for the organization. ([More about permissions.](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))                                                |
| Discard Run         | A plan needs confirmation or a soft-mandatory policy failed.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Cancel Run          | A plan or apply is currently running.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Force Cancel Run    | A plan or apply was canceled, but something went wrong and Terraform Cloud couldn't end the run gracefully. Requires admin access to the workspace. ([More about permissions.](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions)) |
| Retry Run           | A plan-only run has finished. You can also change which Terraform version to use when retrying a plan-only run.                                                                                                                    |

If a plan needs confirmation (with [manual apply](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#auto-apply-and-manual-apply) enabled) or a soft-mandatory policy failed, the run will remain paused until a user with appropriate permissions uses these buttons to continue or discard the run. For more details, see [Run States and Stages](/cloud-docs/run/states).

### Canceling Runs

If a run is currently planning or applying, users with permission to apply runs for the workspace can cancel the run before it finishes, using the **Cancel Run** button on the run's page. ([More about permissions.](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

Canceling a run is roughly equivalent to hitting ctrl+c during a Terraform plan or apply on the CLI. The running Terraform process is sent an INT signal, which instructs Terraform to end its work and wrap up in the safest way possible. (This gives Terraform a chance to update state for any resources that have already been changed, among other things.)

In rare cases, a cancelled run can fail to end gracefully, and will continue to lock the workspace without accomplishing anything useful. These stuck runs can be **force-canceled,** which immediately terminates the running Terraform process and unlocks the workspace.

Since force-canceling can have dangerous side-effects (including loss of state and orphaned resources), it requires admin access to the workspace. ([More about permissions.](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions)) Additionally, the **Force Cancel Run** button only appears after the normal cancel button has been used and a cool-off period has elapsed, to ensure Terraform Cloud has a chance to terminate the run safely.

## Locking Workspaces (Preventing Runs)

You can lock the workspace to temporarily stop runs from being queued. Locking a workspace requires permission to lock and unlock the workspace. Refer to ([Permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions) for details.

A lock prevents Terraform Cloud from performing any plans or applies in the workspace. This includes automatic runs due to new commits in the VCS repository, manual runs queued via the UI, runs started on the command line with `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`, and runs created with the API. New runs remain in the **Pending** state until the workspace is unlocked.

Terraform Cloud shows the lock status in the workspace's header, next to the **Actions** menu.

To lock or unlock a workspace, do one of the following:
- Open the **Actions** menu and select **Lock workspace** or **Unlock workspace**.
- Go to **Settings > Locking**.
