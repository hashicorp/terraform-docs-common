# Overview

<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

Projects let you organize your workspaces and scope access to workspace
resources. Each project has a separate permissions set that you can use to grant
teams access to all workspaces in the project, defining access control
boundaries for teams and their resources. Project-level permissions are more
granular than organization-level permissions, but more specific than individual
workspace-level grants.

When deciding how to structure your projects, consider which groups of resources
need distinct access rules. You may wish to define projects by business units,
departments, subsidiaries, or technical teams.

  Projects](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/projects)
  tutorial. 

## Default Project

Every workspace must belong to exactly one project. By default, all workspaces
belong to an organization's **Default Project**. You can rename the default
project, but you cannot delete it. You can specify a workspace's project at the
time of creation and move it to a different project later. 

The “Manage Workspaces” team permission lets users create and manage workspaces.
Users with this permission can read and manage all workspaces, but new
workspaces are automatically added to the “Default Project” and users cannot
access the metadata for other projects. To create workspaces under other
projects, users also need the "Manage Projects & Workspaces" permission or the
admin role for the project they wish to use.

## Managing Projects

The "Manage all Projects" team permission lets users manage projects. Users with
this permission can view, edit, delete, and assign team access to all of an
organization's projects. Refer to [Managing
Projects](/terraform/cloud-docs/projects/manage) for more details.
