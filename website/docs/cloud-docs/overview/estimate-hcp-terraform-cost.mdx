# Estimate HCP Terraform cost

HCP Terraform offers [multiple plans](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing) with increasing benefits to match your business scale. This page describes the flat rate per managed resource per hour for Standard Edition users on pay-as-you-go billing. Additional options are available such as greater discounts at larger scale with contracted plans. [Contact Sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales) for additional information.

## What is a Managed Resource?

A “Managed Resource” or “Resources Under Management (RUM)” is a resource in a Terraform-Cloud-managed state file where `mode = "managed"`. HCP Terraform counts a resource as part of this count starting from the first `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` operation on the resource. HCP Terraform does not include resources defined as a `null_resource` or `terraform_data` resource in the total managed resource count.

Examples of managed resources include resources provisioned by a Terraform provider (e.g. an AWS VPC), by [count](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) and [for_each](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) meta-arguments, and resources provisioned by [modules](/terraform/language/modules) and [no-code ready modules](/terraform/cloud-docs/no-code-provisioning/module-design).  

## Standard Edition cost on pay-as-you-go billing

HashiCorp charges for each managed resource on a per-hour basis, from the time a managed resource is provisioned until it is destroyed. Each partial hour is billed as a full hour. The peak number of managed resources in a given hour determines the cost. 

Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) or Terraform Enterprise and choose **Usage** from the sidebar to navigate to a report of your organization's total number of managed resources. You can use the total number of managed resources to determine your number of billable managed resources in use at any given time. You can find your total cost in the [HashiCorp Cloud Platform portal](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing#usage), which is refreshed hourly.

The Usage report gives an at a glance view of general usage limits in the Organization:
- A summary of projects, workspaces, and applies
- General limits for managed resources, concurrency, and agents
- Compliance feature set limits for run tasks and policies

An example on HCP Terraform **Standard Edition** that assumes 24x7 usage for a full month for 1000 Managed Resources:

- Per Hour Price: 1000 Managed Resources x $0.0001359 = **$0.14**  
- Per Month Price: (Per Hour Price x 24 x 30) = **$97.85**

Another example calculation factors in billable managed resource counts, partial hour billing, and peak managed resources over a 3-hour period:

- The first hour, 1000 resources are created, calculated to cost $0.14 per hour. 
- Over the next hour, 1000 new resources are added, 500 are changed, and then 500 are destroyed for a peak managed resource count of 2000, billing that previous hour for $0.27 and a total consumption of $0.41. 
- There are no changes in the third hour, for a peak managed resource count of 1500, billed for $0.20 and a total consumption of $0.61.

## Manage your plan

To edit your organization's plan, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io).
1. Select the organization that you want to manage.
1. Navigate to the **Plan & Billing** page.

Pay-as-you-go and HashiCorp Flex customers can self-activate their HCP Terraform organizations. Refer to [Changing Your HCP Terraform Plan](/terraform/cloud-docs/overview/change-plan) for details.

## Downgrade your plan

Pay-as-you-go customers can downgrade to HCP Terraform Free Edition. To downgrade your organization's plan, navigate to the **Plan & Billing** page and click **Downgrade to the free plan**.

HCP Terraform displays a list of the features that you will lose access to when you downgrade to the free edition. Click **Downgrade to free plan** to confirm.

## Optimize cost

Contacting sales is the best option to help you optimize your costs. There, we will discuss contract options such as when you commit to a certain amount of spend or usage. In our contract plans, the larger your usage, the greater your discount compared to the flat rate, pay-as-you-go model. [Contact HashiCorp Sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales) to learn more.
