# Estimate Terraform Cloud Cost

Terraform Cloud offers [multiple plans](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing) with increasing benefits to match your business scale. This page describes the flat rate per managed resource per hour for Standard Edition users on pay-as-you-go billing. Additional options are available such as greater discounts at larger scale with contracted plans. [Contact Sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales) for additional information.

## What is a Managed Resource?

A “Managed Resource” or “Resources Under Management (RUM)” is a resource in a Terraform-Cloud-managed state file where `mode = "managed"`. Terraform Cloud counts a resource as part of this count starting from the first `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` operation on the resource. Terraform Cloud does not include resources defined as a `null_resource` or `terraform_data` resource in the total managed resource count.

Examples of managed resources include resources provisioned by a Terraform provider (e.g. an AWS VPC), by [count](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) and [for_each](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) meta-arguments, and resources provisioned by [modules](/terraform/language/modules) and [no-code ready modules](/terraform/cloud-docs/no-code-provisioning/module-design).  

## Standard Edition Cost on Pay-As-You-Go Billing

HashiCorp charges for each managed resource on a per-hour basis, from the time a managed resource is provisioned until it is destroyed. Each partial hour is billed as a full hour.  Thus, the peak number of managed resources in a given hour is used for billing purposes. 

For Terraform Cloud **Standard Edition**, the first 500 managed resources are free every month. Your organization's **Usage** page reports the total number of managed resources, which you can use to determine the number of billable managed resources in use at any given time.  Total consumption in monetary terms is also reported in the [HashiCorp Cloud Platform portal](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing#hcp-usage) and refreshed every hour.

The Usage report gives an at a glance view of general usage limits in the Organization:
- A summary of projects, workspaces, and applies
- General limits for managed resources, concurrency, and agents
- Compliance feature set limits for run tasks and policies

An example on Terraform Cloud **Standard Edition** that assumes 24x7 usage for a full month for 1000 Managed Resources:

Per Hour Price: 1000 Managed Resources - 500 Free) x $0.0001359 = **$0.07**  
Per Month Price: (Per Hour Price x 24 x 30) = **$48.92**

Another example over a 3-hour billing period that incorporates the concepts of:
- Billable Managed Resource Counts (Resource count following a successful apply)
- Partial Hour Billing (Resources provisioned mid-hour)
- Peak managed resources  (The greatest count of managed resources at any point in the current hour)

![Screenshot: A timeline showing the lifecycle of resources created and destroyed over a three-hour time window. The first hour, 1000 resources are created, calculated to cost $0.07 per hour. Over the next hour, 1000 new resources are added, 500 are changed, and then 500 are destroyed for a peak managed resource count of 2000, billing that previous hour for $0.27. There are no changes in the third hour, for a peak managed resource count of 1500, billed for $0.14.](/img/docs/tfc-payg-example.png)

## Manage Your Plan

In the **Plan & Billing** page in Organization settings, you can view a monthly estimate when you click **Edit Plan**. If your Organization cannot edit its plan due to an active contract, you will not be able to see the estimate in Terraform Cloud and should instead contact your HashiCorp account team.

![Screenshot: The screen for a Terraform Cloud user to choose to upgrade their plan. Two plans are shown. The first is the Standard Edition, listed with the cost per resource per month. The second option is the Plus Edition, instructing the user to contact sales for a price.](/img/docs/tfc-upgrade-plan.png)

Pay-as-you-go and HashiCorp Flex customers can self-activate their Terraform Cloud Organizations. Refer to [Changing Your Terraform Cloud Plan](/terraform/cloud-docs/overview/change-plan) for details.

## Optimizing Cost

Contacting Sales is the best option to help you optimize your costs. There, we will discuss contract options such as when you commit to a certain amount of spend or usage. In our contract plans, the larger your usage, the greater your discount compared to the flat rate, pay-as-you-go model. [Contact HashiCorp Sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales) to learn more.
