# Activate HashiCorp Flex

Follow these steps to activate HashiCorp Flex for a Standard or Plus Edition Terraform Cloud organization. 

## Prerequisites

There are several prerequisites for activating HashiCorp Flex:

1. You must email the HCP organization ID with the HashiCorp sales team. 
1. You must be a member of your Terraform Cloud organization's "owners" team.
1. You must have the HCP organization "admin" or "owner" role.

## Step 1: Create the required user accounts

There are two ways to activate HashiCorp Flex. If you already use Terraform Cloud and HCP, we recommend that you create a unified HCP user account. Otherwise, you can create separate Terraform Cloud and HCP accounts.

### Create a unified HCP user account

1. Go to [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io) and click **Continue with HCP account.** 
1. Create a free HCP account or sign in using your HCP email. If you have an existing Terraform Cloud account, HCP will prompt you to [link it](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#linked-hcp-and-terraform-cloud-accounts). If you do not yet have a Terraform Cloud account, HCP will create one for you and link it to the HCP account.  

### Create separate TFC and HCP user accounts

1. Go to [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io) and create a free account or sign in to your existing one. 
1. Go to [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://cloud.hashicorp.com) and create a free HCP account or sign in to your existing one.  

## Step 2: Provision the required TFC team and HCP roles

After you create your user accounts:

1. **Become a Terraform Cloud organization owner**: A Terraform Cloud organization owner must invite you to the "owners" team. You must be an owner to see the **Plan & Billing** page in the Terraform Cloud organization settings.
1. **Become an HCP admin**: An HCP admin or organization owner must invite you to the HCP organization that HashiCorp Flex is allocated to and grant you the [admin](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/users#organization-role) role. 

Organization members may be owners or admins in only the Terraform Cloud or HCP organization. To safeguard access to your Flex balance, determine whether to invite Terraform Cloud organization owners to the HCP organization, or whether to invite HCP admins to Terraform Cloud.  

**Example**: Multi-Tenant (i.e. Managed Services)

MSP is an HCP admin and manages the billing relationship with HashiCorp Cloud Platform and services customers of Terraform Cloud.  The HCP admin should be invited to the Terraform Cloud customer organizations to activate Flex.

**Example**: Single Tenant (i.e. Organization/Enterprise)

The enterprise is an HCP admin who manages the billing relationship with HashiCorp Cloud Platform and owns all the Terraform Cloud organizations. They can use either approach and invite HCP admins to Terraform Cloud organizations or make Terraform Cloud organization owners into HCP admins.


## Step 3: Verify HashiCorp Flex balance allocation

Navigate to the **HCP Org > Billing**.  If HashiCorp sales has allocated Flex, the page displays a **Contract Summary** with an available balance. If it only shows your credit card information or a $50 free trial credit, your HashiCorp Flex account may be scheduled to be allocated at a future date. Please contact your **HashiCorp Sales Account Manager** for more information.


~> **Note**: All New HashiCorp organizations are automatically allocated $50 in trial credits. If your HashiCorp Flex account is not yet allocated, you can use the trial credits to temporarily activate **Standard Edition** for your Terraform Cloud organization and immediately access paid features such as team management or more concurrency.

## Step 4: Edit the Terraform Cloud organization plan

Navigate to your Terraform Cloud organization setting's **Plan & Billing** page. If your Terraform Cloud user account is not managed by HCP, you will be prompted to log in to an HCP account that has the `admin` role in the HCP organization with HashiCorp Flex allocated. You must have admin privileges in the HCP organization to manage the Terraform Cloud organization's billing plan.

~> **Note**: If you have a unified HCP account, you do not need to log in and Terraform Cloud will automatically identify HCP organizations that your unified HCP user account is a member of and are a member of the Flex Terraform Cloud organization.

Click **Edit Plan** to go to the Plan Activation page.  

If your HashiCorp user account has the `owner` or `admin` role in multiple HCP organizations, you will need to select a billing account.

After selecting a plan, confirm your selection and review the **Cost Estimate**.

If you meet all the necessary [prerequisites](#prerequisites), the **Plan Selection** page will show **HashiCorp Flex** at the bottom left. If you see **Pay-as-you-go**, please review steps 1-3 or [contact HashiCorp support](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for more assistance.

Finally, confirm your selections and verify that the **Monthly estimate** meets your expectations. If you have any questions, contact your HashiCorp Sales Account Manager.
