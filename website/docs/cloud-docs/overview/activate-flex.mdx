# Activate HashiCorp Flex

Follow these steps to activate HashiCorp Flex for a Standard or Plus Edition Terraform Cloud organization. 

## Prerequisites

There are several prerequisites required to activate HashiCorp Flex:

1. You must create an HCP Organization for the HashiCorp Flex balance to be allocated and the HCP organization ID must be provided to the HashiCorp Sales Team. 
1. You must be a member of the "owners" team in your Terraform Cloud organization.
1. You must have the HCP organization admin or owner role.

## Step 1: Create the Required User Accounts

There are two ways to activate HashiCorp Flex. If you already use Terraform Cloud and HCP, we recommend that you create a unified HCP user account. Otherwise, you can create separate Terraform Cloud and HCP accounts.

### Create a Unified HCP User Account

Go to [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io) and click **Continue with HCP account.** Create a free HCP account or sign in using your HCP email. If you have an existing Terraform Cloud account, HCP will prompt you to [link it](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#linked-hcp-and-terraform-cloud-accounts). If you do not yet have a Terraform Cloud account, HCP will create one for you and link it to the HCP account.  

### Create separate TFC and HCP user accounts

1. Go to [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io) and create a free account or sign in to your existing one. 
1. Go to [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://cloud.hashicorp.com) and create a free HCP account or sign in to your existing one.  

## Step 2: Provision the Required TFC Team and HCP Roles

After you create your user accounts:

1. **Become a Terraform Cloud organization owner**: A Terraform Cloud organization owner must invite you to the "owners" team. You must be an owner to see the **Plan & Billing** page in the Terraform Cloud organization settings.
1. **Become an HCP admin**: An HCP admin or organization owner must invite you to the HCP organization that HashiCorp Flex is allocated to and grant you the [admin](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/users#organization-role) role. 

In many situations, you may be a TFC organization owner, but not an HCP admin, or you might be an HCP admin, but not a TFC organization owner.  Decide which security policy is best for your organization to safeguard access to your Flex balance by determining if the TFC organization owners should be invited to the HCP organization, or if the HCP admin should be invited to TFC.  

**Example**: Managed Services (MSP)

MSP is an HCP admin and manages the billing relationship with HashiCorp Cloud Platform. and services customers of TFC.  The HCP admin should be invited to the TFC customer organizations to activate Flex.

**Example**: Multi-Tenant Enterprise

The Enterprise is an HCP admin and manages the billing relationship with HashiCorp Cloud Platform, as well as owns all the TFC organizations.  The Enterprise can choose either approach to invite the HCP admin to TFC, or TFC organization owners to become HCP Admins.


## Step 3: Verify HashiCorp Flex Balance allocation

Navigate to the **HCP Org > Billing**.  If HashiCorp Flex is allocated, you will see a **Contract Summary** with an available balance. In the event that you don't see your available balance, you only see your credit card information, or you see a $50 free trial credit, your HashiCorp Flex account may be scheduled to be allocated at a future date. Please contact your **HashiCorp Sales Account Manager** for more information.


~> **Note**: All New HashiCorp organizations are automatically allocated $50 in trial credits. If your HashiCorp Flex account is not yet allocated, you can use the trial credits to temporarily activate **Standard Edition** for your Terraform Cloud organization and immediately access paid features such as [Team Management](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams) or more concurrency.

## Step 4: Edit the Terraform Cloud Organization Plan

Navigate to the TFC organization setting's **Plan & Billing** page. For TFC user accounts that are not unified with HCP user accounts, you will be asked to login to an HCP account that has the `admin` role in the HCP organization with HashiCorp Flex allocated.  This login is required to allow you to edit the TFC organization's plan.  

~> **Note**: If you have a unified HCP account, you do not need to login and TFC will automatically identify qualified HCP organizations that your unified HCP user account is a member of.

Click **Edit Plan** to go to the Plan Activation page.  

If your HashiCorp user account has the `owner` or `admin` role in multiple HCP organizations, you will need to select a billing account.

After selecting a plan, confirm your selection and review the **Cost Estimate**.

If you meet all the necessary [prerequisites](#prerequisites), the **Plan Selection** page will show “HashiCorp Flex” at the bottom left. If you see “Pay-as-you-go,” please review steps 1-3 or [contact HashiCorp support](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for more assistance.

Finally, confirm your selections and verify that the **Monthly estimate** meets your expectations. If you have any questions, contact your HashiCorp Sales Account Manager.
