# Activating HashiCorp Flex

Use this step-by-step procedure to activate a Terraform Cloud Organization onto Standard Edition or Plus Editions on HashiCorp Flex. 

## Step 1: Create the Required User Accounts

You can either:


### Create separate TFC and HCP user accounts

1. Go to app.terraform.io and create a free account or sign in using their TFC Username or TFC email.
1. Go to cloud.hashicorp.com and create a free HCP account or sign in using your HCP email.  

### Create a Unified HCP User Account:

1. Go to app.terraform.io and click “Continue with HCP account.” Create a free HCP account or sign in using your HCP email. If you have an existing Terraform Cloud account, you will be prompted to [link it to your HCP account](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#linked-hcp-and-terraform-cloud-accounts). If you don't yet have a Terraform Cloud account, one will be generated for you and linked to your HCP account.  

## Step 2: Provision the Required TFC Team and HCP Roles

After the user accounts have been created:
1. **Become a TFC Org Owner**: Ask another TFC Org Owner to invite you to the “owners” Team.  This is required for you to see the “Plan & Billing” page in the TFC Org Settings.
1. **Become an HCP Admin**: Ask another HCP Org Admin or HCP Org Owner to invite you to the same HCP Org where HashiCorp Flex is allocated. Additionally, ask them to invite you with the [admin](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/iam/users#organization-role) role. 

## Step 3: Verify HashiCorp Flex Balance is Allocated

Navigate to the **HCP Org > Billing**.  If HashiCorp Flex is allocated, you should see a **Contract Summary** with an Available balance. In the event you don't see your available balance or you only see your Credit Card information or $50 Free Trial Credit, your HashiCorp Flex account may be scheduled to be allocated at a future date.  Please contact your **HashiCorp Sales Account Manager** for more information.


~> **Note**: All New HashiCorp Orgs are automatically allocated $50 in trial credits. In the event the HashiCorp Flex account is not yet allocated and can be used to temporarily activate Standard Edition at no cost for immediate access to TFC paid functionality like [Team Management](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams) or more concurrency.

## Step 4: Edit the Terraform Cloud Org Plan

Navigate to the TFC Org Settings > Plan & Billing.  For TFC user accounts that are not unified with HCP user accounts, you will be asked to login to the HCP account that is an Admin of the HCP Org with HashiCorp Flex allocated.  This login is required to enable editing of the TFC Org's plan.  

~> **Note**: If you have a unified HCP account, you do not need to login and TFC will automatically identify qualified HCP orgs that your unified HCP user account is a member of.

Click Edit Plan to be brought to the Plan Activation “Wizard.”  

If your HashiCorp user account is an Owner or Admin of multiple HCP Orgs, you will be asked to select which Billing Account to configure against.





After selecting a plan, confirm your Selection and review the Cost Estimate.

If you meet all the necessary prerequisites, the Plan Selection page will show “HashiCorp Flex” at the bottom left. If you see “Pay-as-you-go,” please re-review steps 1-3 or Contact Terraform Support for more assistance.



In the final step, confirm your selections and determine if the Monthly estimate meets your expectations.  If there is any doubt, contact your HashiCorp Sales Account Manager.
