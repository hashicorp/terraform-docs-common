# Activate HashiCorp Flex

Follow these steps to activate HashiCorp Flex for a **Standard**, **Plus**, or **Premium** edition HCP Terraform organization. 

## Prerequisites

To activate HashiCorp Flex, you must:

1. [Create an HCP organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs#create-an-organization).
1. Be a member of your HCP Terraform organization's "owners" team.
1. Have the "admin" or "owner" role in your HCP Organization.

## Step 1: Create the required user accounts

There are two ways to activate HashiCorp Flex. If you already use both HCP Terraform and HCP, we recommend that you create a linked HCP user account. Otherwise, you can create separate HCP Terraform and HCP accounts.

### Create a linked HCP user account

1. Go to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io) and click **Continue with HCP account.** 
1. Create a free HCP account or sign in using your HCP email. If you have an existing HCP Terraform account, HCP prompts you to [link it](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#linking-hcp-and-hcp-terraform-accounts). If you do not have an HCP Terraform account, HCP creates one for you and links it to the HCP account.  

### Create separate HCP Terraform and HCP user accounts

1. Go to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io) and create a free account or sign in to your existing one. 
1. Go to [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://cloud.hashicorp.com) and create a free HCP account or sign in to your existing one.  

## Step 2: Provision the required HCP Terraform team and HCP roles

Organization members may be owners or admins in either the HCP Terraform or HCP organization, but not both. To safeguard your Flex balance, determine whether to invite HCP Terraform organization owners to the HCP organization, or HCP admins to HCP Terraform. 

Consider the following to decide which approach is right for your organization:
- The HCP admin offers HCP Terraform as a multi-tenant managed service. They manage the billing relationship with HashiCorp Cloud Platform and services customers of HCP Terraform.  The HCP admin should be invited to the HCP Terraform customer organizations to activate Flex.
- The HCP admin manages the billing relationship with HashiCorp Cloud Platform and owns all the HCP Terraform organizations. They can use either approach and invite HCP admins to HCP Terraform organizations or make HCP Terraform organization owners into HCP admins.

After you create your user accounts:

1. **Become an HCP Terraform organization owner**: an HCP Terraform organization owner must invite you to the "owners" team. You must be an owner to see the **Plan & Billing** page in the HCP Terraform organization settings.
1. **Become an HCP admin**: An HCP admin or organization owner must invite you to the HCP organization that HashiCorp Flex is allocated to and grant you the [admin](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management#organization) role. 


## Step 3: Activate your Flex plan

Your sales account manager will email your organization's tech contact a code to activate your HCP Flex plan a day or two before your plan begins. 

To activate your Flex plan:
1. Copy the HCP Flex activation code from your email.
1. Click the link in your activation email to access your HCP organization or log into your [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/). 
1. Navigate to **Billing > Payment Methods** and find the **Contract** section.
1. Paste the activation code you copied to the **Contract** section.

HCP will notify you if your contract is successfully activated. Your Flex balance may take up to an hour to appear. 

## Step 4: Verify HashiCorp Flex balance allocation

Navigate to the **HCP Org > Billing**. If HashiCorp sales has allocated Flex, the page displays a **Contract Summary** with an available balance. If it only shows your credit card information or a $500 free trial credit, your HashiCorp Flex account may be scheduled to be allocated at a future date. Please contact your **HashiCorp Sales Account Manager** for more information.

~> **Note**: All New HashiCorp organizations are automatically allocated $500 in trial credits. If your HashiCorp Flex account is not yet allocated, you can use the trial credits to temporarily activate **Standard Edition** for your HCP Terraform organization and immediately access paid features such as team management or more concurrency.

## Step 4: Edit the HCP Terraform organization plan

Navigate to your HCP Terraform organization setting's **Plan & Billing** page. If your HCP Terraform user account is not managed by HCP, you will be prompted to log in to an HCP account that has the `admin` role in the HCP organization with HashiCorp Flex allocated. You must have admin privileges in the HCP organization to manage the HCP Terraform organization's billing plan.  

![Prompt for user to link their HCP Terraform account to an HCP account](/img/docs/tfc-plan-and-billing.png)

~> **Note**: If you have a linked HCP account, you do not need to log in and HCP Terraform will automatically identify HCP organizations that your linked HCP user account is a member of and are a member of the Flex HCP Terraform organization.

Click **Edit Plan** to go to the Plan Activation page.  

If your HashiCorp user account has the `owner` or `admin` role in multiple HCP organizations, you will need to select a billing account.

After selecting a plan, confirm your selection and review the **Cost Estimate**.

If you meet all the necessary [prerequisites](#prerequisites), the **Plan Selection** page will show **HashiCorp Flex** at the bottom left. If you see **Pay-as-you-go**, please review steps 1-3 or [contact HashiCorp support](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for more assistance.

Finally, confirm your selections and verify that the **Monthly estimate** meets your expectations. If you have any questions, contact your HashiCorp Sales Account Manager.
