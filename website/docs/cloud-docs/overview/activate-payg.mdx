# Pay-as-you-go

Pay-as-you-go accounts are billed for the resources consumed. You can use pay-as-you-go for the **Standard**, **Plus**, and **Premium** editions. 

Pay-as-you-go offers dynamic billing based on monthly consumption. Larger organizations can access lower rates through Flex contracts. Review the [billing model documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing#billing-models) to determine which model is right for your organization.

## Activate pay-as-you-go

To enable pay-as-you-go and change your organization's plan, sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) and select your organization. Then choose **Settings** from the sidebar, then **Plan & Billing**. 

In order to upgrade to **Standard**, **Plus**, or **Premium** edition and use pay-as-you-go billing, you must sign in to your HashiCorp Cloud Platform account and [link](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#linking-hcp-and-hcp-terraform-accounts) your HCP Terraform account to your [HashiCorp Cloud Platform billing account](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing). Click **Edit plan** to authenticate with HCP and link your accounts.

Under **How would you like to activate HCP Terraform**, select **On a Hashicorp Trial or Pay-as-you-go account**.

Select the HCP organization to bill your usage to. Then click **Next**. 

Select the plan to use for your organization, then click **Next**.

Review your plan summary, then click **Activate**. Once activated, the new feature set will be available and usage and consumption will start immediately. Refer to [Estimate HCP Terraform cost](/terraform/cloud-docs/overview/estimate-hcp-terraform-cost) for more information on how to review your organization's consumption.

## Manage billing

Billing is managed on HashiCorp Cloud Platform. There you can:
- Review your organization's [usage](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing#usage).
- Change the [credit card](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/pay-as-you-go#change-credit-card) used for payment.
- Setup a [Flex Billing Contract](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/flex-multiyear).
