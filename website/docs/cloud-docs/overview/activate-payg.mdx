# Activating Pay-As-You Go

In order to upgrade to **Standard Edition** or **Plus Edition**, you must login to your HashiCorp Cloud Platform account or have your Terraform Cloud account [linked](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#linked-hcp-and-terraform-cloud-accounts) with your [HashiCorp Cloud Platform billing account](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing).

Once logged in, you will be able to Edit your Terraform Cloud plan.

## Link to a HashiCorp Cloud Platform Organization

When editing a Terraform Cloud plan, you have several [billing model](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing#billing-models) options:
- Set up billing for the first time on a Trial or Pay-as-you-go HCP Billing account. Trial credits are consumed before a credit card is billed. Consumption is incurred every hour and invoiced monthly.
- Select an existing [HashiCorp Flex](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/flex-billing) account.  Consumption is incurred every hour.

## Select a Plan

You can compare the feature sets for **Standard** and **Plus** Edition as well as estimate the monthly costs based on the number of managed resources in your Organization.

## Choose HCP Billing Account

If you selected [Trial or pay-as-you-go HCP Billing accounts], you will be asked if you want to instead commit to a long term enterprise contract.  If not, continue and activate on your trial credit balance or credit card.

## Plan Summary

The summary will confirm all the decisions in prior steps. Here you can decide to activate the plan or cancel the process.  Once activated, the new feature set will be available and usage and consumption will start immediately. See [Usage Metering and Cost Calculation](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/flex-billing#usage-metering-and-cost-calculation) for more information on how to review usage and consumption.
