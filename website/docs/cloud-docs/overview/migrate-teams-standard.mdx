# Migrate from legacy Team Edition to Standard Edition

This topic describes how to migrate HCP Terraform from the legacy Team Edition to the Standard Edition. Refer to [HCP Terraform Plans and Features](/terraform/cloud-docs/overview) for an overview of the editions you can subscribe to. 

## Prerequisites

Create or log in to your HashiCorp Cloud Platform account. If you already have an HCP Terraform account, you must instead link it to your [HashiCorp Cloud Platform billing account](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing). Refer to [Linked HCP and HCP Terraform Accounts](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#linked-hcp-and-hcp-terraform-accounts) for instructions.  

## Migrate editions

Complete the following steps to migrate from the Team Edition to the Standard Edition:

1. Navigate to your organization's **Settings** page, then click **Plan & billing**.

1. When prompted, choose the **Standard** plan and click **Next**. The pay-as-you-go offering only includes the **Standard** Edition feature set. To migrate to the **Plus** Edition, contact [HashiCorp Sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales).

## Plan summary

The plan summary screen shows a cost estimate and provides a link to add a credit card. No credit card is required to try HCP Terraform Standard Edition.

The **Standard** Edition feature set is available once you activate the new plan. Usage and consumption start immediately. Refer to [Usage Metering and Cost Calculation](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/flex-billing#usage-metering-and-cost-calculation) for more information on how to review your organization's usage and consumption.

## View account information

You can track usage, consumption, and billing invoices on HashiCorp Cloud Platform. Refer to the following topics for additional information:
