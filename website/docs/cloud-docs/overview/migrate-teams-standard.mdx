# Migrate from legacy Team Edition to Standard Edition

This topic describes how to migrate Terraform Cloud from the legacy Team Edition to the Standard Edition. Refer to [Terraform Cloud Plans and Features](/terraform/cloud-docs/overview) for an overview of the editions you can subscribe to. 

## Prerequisistes

Create or log in to your HashiCorp Cloud Platform account. If you already have a Terraform Cloud account, you must instead link it to your [HashiCorp Cloud Platform billing account](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing). Refer to [Linked HCP and Terraform Cloud Accounts](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#linked-hcp-and-terraform-cloud-accounts) for instructions.  

## Migrate editions

Complete the following steps to migrate from the Team Edition to the Standard Edition:

1. Navigate to your organization's **Settings** page, then click **Plan & billing**.
