# Migrate from legacy Team Edition to new Standard Edition

To migrate from the legacy Terraform Cloud **Team** Edition to the new **Standard** Edition, you must create or log in to your HashiCorp Cloud Platform account. If you already have a Terraform Cloud account, you must instead [link](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#linked-hcp-and-terraform-cloud-accounts) it with your [HashiCorp Cloud Platform billing account](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing). 

First, navigate to your organization's **Settings** page, then click **Plan & billing**.

Next, click **Edit plan**.

## Create or select a HashiCorp Cloud Platform organization

If your HashiCorp Cloud Platform account is new or recently created, you can automatically create a new HCP organization. All HCP Organizations include $50 free Trial credits.

## Select Standard plan

The pay-as-you-go offering only includes the **Standard** Edition feature set.  To migrate to the **Plus** Edition, contact [HashiCorp Sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales).

Select the **Standard** plan, then click **Next**.

## Plan Summary

The plan summary screen shows a cost estimate and provides a link to add a credit card. No credit card is required to try Terraform Cloud Standard Edition.
The new **Standard** Edition feature set is available once you activate the new plan. Usage and consumption will start immediately. Refer to [Usage Metering and Cost Calculation](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/flex-billing#usage-metering-and-cost-calculation) for more information on how to review your organization's usage and consumption.

## Viewing Usage, Consumption, & Billing Invoices

Billing is managed on HashiCorp Cloud Platform. There you can:

- [View usage](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing#hcp-usage) related to managed resources
- Update [credit card payment](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/payment)
- Setup a [Flex Billing Contract](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/payment#set-up-an-entitlement-or-hashicorp-flextm-billing-contract)
