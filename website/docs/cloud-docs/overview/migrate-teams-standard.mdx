# Migrate from legacy team edition to the standard edition

This topic describes how to migrate HCP Terraform from the legacy Team Edition to the Standard Edition. Refer to [HCP Terraform Plans and Features](/terraform/cloud-docs/overview) for an overview of the editions you can subscribe to. 

## Prerequisites

Create or log in to your HashiCorp Cloud Platform account. If you already have an HCP Terraform account, you must instead link it to your [HashiCorp Cloud Platform billing account](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing). Refer to [Linked HCP and HCP Terraform Accounts](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#linked-hcp-and-hcp-terraform-accounts) for instructions.  

## Migrate editions

Complete the following steps to migrate from the Team Edition to the Standard Edition:

1. Navigate to your organization's **Settings** page, then click **Plan & billing**.

1. Click **Edit plan**.

1. HCP prompts you to create a new organization if your HashiCorp Cloud Platform account is new or recently created. Click **Create HCP organization** to create a new HCP organization. All HCP Organizations include $500 free Trial credits.

1. When prompted, choose any available plan and click **Next**.

## Plan summary

The plan summary screen shows a cost estimate and provides a link to add a credit card. No credit card is required to try HCP Terraform Standard Edition.

The **Standard** Edition feature set is available once you activate the new plan. Usage and consumption start immediately. Refer to [Estimate HCP Terraform cost](/terraform/cloud-docs/overview/estimate-hcp-terraform-cost) for more information on how to review your organization's usage and consumption.
