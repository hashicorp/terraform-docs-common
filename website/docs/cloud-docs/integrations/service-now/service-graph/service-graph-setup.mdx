# ServiceNow Service Graph Connector for Terraform

-> **Note:** Follow the [Configure ServiceNow Service Graph Connector for Terraform Cloud](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/it-saas/servicenow-sgc) tutorial for hands-on instructions on how to import an AWS resource deployed in your Terraform Cloud organization to the ServiceNow CMDB by using the Service Graph Connector for Terraform.

The ServiceNow Service Graph Connector for Terraform is a certified scoped application available in the ServiceNow Store. Search for ”Service Graph Connector for Terraform” published by ”HashiCorp Inc” and click **Install**.

## Prerequisites

To start using the Service Graph Connector for Terraform, you must have:

- An administrator account on a Terraform Enterprise instance or within a Terraform Cloud organization.
- An administrator account on your ServiceNow vendor instance.

The Service Graph Connector for Terraform supports the following ServiceNow server versions:

- San Diego
- Tokyo
- Utah

The following ServiceNow plugins are required dependencies:

- ITOM Discovery License
- Integration Commons for CMDB
- Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
- ServiceNow IntegrationHub Standard Pack

Additionally, you can install the IntegrationHub ETL application if you want to modify the default CMDB mappings.

-> **Note:** Dependent plugins are installed on your ServiceNow instance automatically when the app is downloaded from the ServiceNow Store. Before installing the Service Graph Connector for Terraform, you must activate the ITOM Discovery License plugin in your production instance. 

## Connect ServiceNow to Terraform Cloud

-> **ServiceNow roles:** `admin`, `x_hashi_service_gr.terraform_user`

Once the integration is installed, you can proceed to the guided setup form where you will enter your Terraform credentials. This step will establish a secure connection between Terraform Cloud and your ServiceNow instance.

### Create and scope Terraform API token

In order for ServiceNow to connect to Terraform Cloud, you must give it a Terraform Cloud API token. The permissions of this token determine what resources the Service Graph Connector will import into the CMDB. While you could use a user API token, it could import resources from multiple organizations. By providing a team API token, you can scope permissions to only import resources from specified workspaces within a single organization. 

Visit your organization’s **Settings** > **Teams** page. Scroll down to the **Team API Token** section and click **Create a team token**.
Save this token in a safe place since Terraform Cloud only displays it once. You will use it to configure ServiceNow in the next section.

### Configure Service Graph Connector for Terraform API token

In the top navigation of your ServiceNow instance's control panel, click on **All**, search for **Service Graph Connector for Terraform**, and click **SG-Setup**. Next, click **Get Started**.

Next, in the **Configure the Terraform connection** section, click **Get Started**.

In the **Configure Terraform authentication credentials** section, click **Configure**. 

If you want to route traffic between your Terraform Cloud and the ServiceNow instance through a MID server acting as a proxy, change the **Applies to** dropdown to "Specific MID servers" and select your previously configured MID server name. If you don't use MID servers, leave the default value.

Set the **API Key** to the Terraform Cloud team API token that you created in the previous section and click **Update**.

![ServiceNow Service Graph Connector API Key Credentials configuration screen. The API key is provided, then saved by clicking the Update button](/img/docs/service-now-service-graph-apikey.png)

In the **Configure Terraform authentication credentials** section, click **Mark as Complete**.

### Configure Terraform Webhook Notification token

To improve security, Terraform Cloud includes an HMAC signature on all "generic" webhook notifications using a user-provided **token**. This token is an arbitrary secret string that Terraform Cloud uses to sign each webhook notification. ServiceNow uses the same token to verify the request authenticity. Refer to [Notification Authenticity](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/notification-configurations#notification-authenticity) for more information.

Create a token and save it in a safe place. This secret token can be any value but should be treated as sensitive.

In the **Configure Terraform Webhook token** section, click **Configure**. In the **Token** field, enter the secret token that will be shared between the Terraform Cloud and your ServiceNow instance and click **Update**. 

![ServiceNow Service Graph Connector Webhook token configuration screen. The Token is provided, then saved by clicking the Update button](/img/docs/service-now-service-graph-webhook-token.png)

In the **Configure Terraform Webhook token** section, click **Mark as Complete**.

### Configure Terraform connection

In the **Configure Terraform connection** section, click **Configure**.

If you are using Terraform Enterprise, set the **Connection URL** to the URL of your Terraform Enterprise instance. If you are using Terraform Cloud, leave the **Connection URL** as the default value of `https://app.terraform.io`.

![ServiceNow Service Graph Connector HTTP Connection configuration screen. A Terraform Enterprise URL may be provided in the Connection URL field, the saved by clicking the Update button](/img/docs/service-now-service-graph-tfconn.png)

If you want to use a MID server, check **Use MID server** box, change **MID Selection** dropdown to "Specific MID sever" and select your previously configured and validated MID server.

Click **Update** to save these settings. In the **Configure Terraform connection** section, click **Mark as Complete**.

## Import Resources

Refer to the documentation explaining the difference between the [two modes of import](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-graph/index#two-modes-of-import) offered by the Service Graph Connector for Terraform. Both options may be enabled, or you may choose to enable only the webhook or scheduled import.

### Configure scheduled import

In the **Set up scheduled import job** section of the setup form, proceed to **Configure the scheduled jobs** and click **Configure**. 

You can use the **Execute Now** option to run a single import job, which is useful for testing. The import set will be displayed in the table below the scheduled import form, after refreshing the page. Once the import is successfully triggered, click on the **Import Set** field of the record to view the logs associated with the import run, as well as its status.

Activate the job by checking the **Activate** box. Set the **Repeat Interval** and click **Update**. Note that the import processing time depends of the number of organizations and workspaces in your Terraform Cloud. Setting the import job to run frequently is not recommended for big environments.

![ServiceNow Service Graph Connector scheduled import screen](/img/docs/service-now-service-graph-scheduled-import.png)

You can also access the scheduler interface by searching for **Service Graph Connector for Terraform** in the top navigation menu and selecting **SG-Import Schedule**.

### Configure Terraform Webhook

In the top navigation, click on **All**, search for **Scheduled Imports**, and click on **Scheduled Imports**. 

Select the **SG-Terraform Scheduled Process State** record, then click **To edit the record click here**.

Click the **Active** checkbox to enable it. Leave the default value for the **Repeat Interval** of 5 seconds. Click **Update**.

![ServiceNow Service Graph Connector scheduled import screen showing the Active checkbox enabled](/img/docs/service-now-service-graph-webhook-schedule.png)

Next, create the webhook in Terraform Cloud. Select a workspace and click **Settings > Notifications**. Click **Create a Notification**.

Keep the **Destination** as the default option of **Webhook**. Choose a descriptive name **Name**.

Set the **Webhook URL** enter `https://<SERVICENOW_HOSTNAME>/api/x_hashi_service_gr/sg_terraform_webhook` and replace `<SERVICENOW_HOSTNAME>` with the hostname of your ServiceNow instance.

In the **Token** field, enter the same string you provided in **Terraform Webhook token** section the of the Service Graph guided setup form.

Under **Health Events** choose **No events**.

Under **Run Events** choose **Only certain events** and enable notifications only on **Completed** runs. Click **Create Notification**.

![Terraform Cloud notification creation screen, showing a webhook pointing to ServiceNow which is only triggered on completed runs](/img/docs/service-now-service-graph-webhook-tfc.png)

Trigger a run in your workspace. Once the run is successfully completed, a webhook notification request will be sent to your ServiceNow instance.

### Monitor the import job

By following these steps, you can track the status of import jobs in ServiceNow and verify the completion of the import process before accessing the imported resources in the CMDB.

For scheduled imports, navigate back to the **SG-Import Schedule** interface. For webhook imports, go to the **SG-Terraform Scheduled Process State** interface.

Under the form, you will find a table containing all registered import sets. Locate and select the relevant import set record.

Click on the **Import Set** field to open it and view its details. The **Outbound Http Requests** tab lists all requests made by your ServiceNow instance to Terraform Cloud in order to retrieve the latest Terraform state.

Monitor the state of the import job. Wait for it to change to **Complete**, indicated by a green mark.
Once the import job is complete, you can access the imported resources in the CMDB.

![ServiceNow Service Graph Connector: import set with successfully completed status](/img/docs/service-now-service-graph-import-set.png)

You can also access all import sets, regardless of the import type, by navigating to **All** and selecting **Import Sets** under the **Advanced** category.

### View resources in ServiceNow CMDB

In the top navigation of ServiceNow, click on **All** and search for **CMDB Workspace**, and click on **CMDB Workspace**. 

Perform a search by entering a Configuration Item (CI) name in the **Search** field (for example, **Virtual Machine Instance**). CI names supported by the application are listed on the [resource mapping page](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-graph/resource-coverage).
