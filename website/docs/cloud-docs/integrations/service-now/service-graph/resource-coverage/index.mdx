# Resource Coverage and Mapping

The tables provided in this section illustrate the mapping of resources from the Terraform state to the ServiceNow CMDB configuration items (CIs) by the Service Graph Connector for Terraform.

While the default ETL map provided by the application can be utilized without modification, it is also possible to customize it according to the specific requirements of your organization. Check [customizations](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-graph/customizations) for more details.

The application supports selected resources from major cloud providers. The following pages provide mapping details for each supported provider:

- [AWS](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-graph/resource-coverage/aws)
- [Azure](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-graph/resource-coverage/azure)
- [GCP](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-graph/resource-coverage/gcp)
- [VMware vSphere](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-graph/resource-coverage/vsphere)

# Importing Tags

The Service Graph Connector for Terraform imports the Terraform tags associated with your resource into CMDB. Tags are mapped to the **Key Value** CI Class.
Along with the tags assigned in your Terraform code, the integration also includes `tf_organization` and `tf_workspace` tags. These tags are used to indicate the Terraform Cloud organization and workspace where the resource was provisioned.

The visibility of the **Tags** tab in CMDB varies for different configuration items. By default, not every configuration item has the **Tags** tab enabled. For instance, the **Virtual Machine Instance** class page includes the **Tags** tab, whereas the **AWS Cloud ECS Cluster** page does not.

The following example illustrates how the **Tags** tab can be enabled for **AWS Cloud ECS Cluster** CI class in CMDB.

1. Enter `cmdb_ci_cloud_ecs_cluster.list` in the search menu of your ServiceNow instance. 
2. Open any record. Right-click on the gray bar at the top, select **Configure** and proceed to **Related Lists**. If you are in a different scope, click **Edit this view**.
3. Transfer **Key Value->Configuration item** from the left column to the right and click **Save**. Tags become available in CMDB for all AWS ECS cluster records.
