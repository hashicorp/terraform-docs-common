# Example Customizations

This example use case creates a Terraform Catalog Item for requesting resources
with custom variable values passed to the Terraform configuration.

## Make a copy of the existing Catalog Item

The application provides pre-configured [Catalog
Items](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#example-service-catalog-flows-and-actions)
for immediate use. We suggest you create a copy of the most recent version of the
Catalog Item to ensure you have access to the latest features and
improvements. Make a copy of the most appropriate Catalog Item for your specific
business requirements by following these steps:

1. Navigate to **All > Service Catalog > Catalogs > Terraform Catalog**, review the available
   Catalog Items and identify those based on Flows, which are denoted by the
   suffix "Flow" in their names. When you select a Catalog Item, we
   recommended you choose those based on Flows rather than Workflows. 
   Flows provide enhanced functionality, improved performance, and
   are actively supported and developed by ServiceNow. For more information, refer 
   to the [Catalog Items based on Flows vs. Workflows](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#example-service-catalog-flows-and-actions) documentation.
1. Open the Catalog Item in the editing mode: 
   1. Click the Catalog Item to open the request form. 
   1. Click **...** in the top right corner. 
   1. Select **Configure Item** from the menu.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Configure Catalog Item](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-configure-item.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Configure Catalog Item dropdown menu")
1. Access the **Process Engine** tab in the Catalog Item configuration. Take
   note of the Flow name associated with the Catalog Item, as you will need to
   create a copy of this Flow as well.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Process Engine](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-process-engine.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Configure Catalog Item – Process Engine tab")
1. Start the copying process: 
   1. Click the **Copy** button above the **Related Links** section. 
   1. Assign a new name to the copied Catalog Item. 
   1. Optionally, modify the description and short description fields. 
      Right-click the header and select **Save**.

## Adjust the Variable Set

If a Catalog Item requires users to input variable values,
you must update the variable set with the required variables.
Although some default Catalog Items come with pre-defined example variables, it
is common practice to remove these and replace them with your own custom
variables.

1. Create a new Variable Set.
   1. On the Catalog Item's configuration page, under the **Related Links**
      section, click the Variable Sets tab.
   1. Click the **New** button to create a new variable set. Ensure that the
   variables in your new set match the variables required by your Terraform
   configuration.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow New Variable Set](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-new-varset.png)
   1. Select "Single-Row Variable Set" and provide a title and description.
   1. Click **Submit**. Upon submission, you will be redirected back to the Catalog
   Item's configuration page.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow New Variable Set Form](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-new-varset-form.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Catalog Item – new Variable Set")
   1. Click the name of your newly created Variable Set and create your 
   variables. You must follow the [naming convention for Terraform
   variables](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#terraform-variables-and-servicenow-variable-sets).
   ServiceNow offers various types of variable representation (ssuch as trings,
   booleans, and dropdown menus). Refer to the [ServiceNow documentation on
   variables](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_ServiceCatalogVariables.html&version=latest)
   and select the types that best suit your use case. You can also set default
   values for the variables in the **Default Value** tab, which ServiceNow will prefilled
   for the end URLSearchParams.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow New Variables](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-variables.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Catalog Item – new variables")
1. Attach the newly created Variable Set to your custom Catalog Item and remove
the default Workspace Variables.
   1. Return to the Variable Sets tab on the Catalog Item's configuration page
   and click the **Edit** button. 
   1. Move the "Workspace Variables" Set from the right side to the left side
   and click **Save**. Do not remove the
   "Workspace Request Create" or the "Workspace Request Update" Sets.

## Make a copy of the Flow and Action

1. Open the ServiceNow Studio by navigating to **All > Studio** and open the
      "Terraform" application. Once in the "Terraform" application, navigate to
      "Flow Designer" > "Flows".
1. Open the Flow referenced in your Catalog Item. Click **...**
   in the top right corner of the Flow Designer interface and 
   select **Copy flow**. Provide a name for the copied Flow and
   click **Copy**.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Copy Flow Interface](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-copy-flow.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Flow Designer – copying a Flow")
1. Customize your newly copied Flow by clicking **Edit flow**.
![Screenshot: ServiceNow Edit New Flow Interface](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-edit-flow.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Flow Designer – editing a Flow")
   1. Do not change the Trigger of "Service Catalog".
   1. Update the "Get Catalog Variables" action:
      1. Keep the "Requested Item Record" in the **Submitted Request** field
         without changes.
      1. Select your newly created Catalog Item from the dropdown menu for
         **Template Catalog Item**.
      1. Move all of your variables to the **Selected** side in the **Catalog
         Variables** section. Remove any previous example variables from the
         **Available** side.
         ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Get Variables Flow Step](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-get-variables.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Flow Designer – getting Variables step")
      1. Click **Done** to finish configuring this Action.
   1. Unfold the second Action in the Flow and click the arrow to open it in
      the Action Designer.
      ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Open Action Designer](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-open-action.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Action Designer")
      1. Click **...** in the top right corner and select **Copy Action*".
         ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Copy Action](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-copy-action.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Copy Action")
         Rename it and click **Copy**.
         ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Rename Action](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-rename-action.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Rename Action")
      1. In the the Inputs section, remove any previous example variables.
      ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Remove Variables From Action](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-remove-example-variables-from-action.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Action Input Variables")
      1. Add your custom variables by clicking the **Create Input** button. Ensure
         that the variable names match your Catalog Item variables and select the
         variable type that matches each variable. Click **Save**.
         ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Add Variables To Action](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-add-variables-to-action.png "Screenshot of adding ServiceNow Action Input Variables")
      1. Open the **Script step** within the Action. Remove any example variables
         and add your custom variables by clicking **Create Variable** at the
         bottom. Enter the name of each variable and drag the corresponding data
         pill from the right into the **Value field**.
         ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Add Script Step Variables To Action](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-adjust-script-variables.png "Screenshot of adjusting ServiceNow Action Script Variables")
      1. Click **Save** and then **Publish**.
1. Reopen the Flow and attach the newly created Action to the Flow
   after "Get Catalog Variables" step:
   1. Remove the previous Action that you copied earlier and replace it with
      your newly created Action.
      ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Replace Action Step](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-replace-action.png "Screenshot of replacing ServiceNow Action step")
   1. Connect the new Action to the Flow by dragging and dropping the data pills
      from the "Get Catalog Variables" Action to the corresponding inputs of
      your new Action. Click **Done** to save this step.
      ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Fill Variables for Action](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-fill-new-action-step.png "Screenshot of filling out ServiceNow Action variables")
   1. Click **Save**.
   1. Click **Activate**.

## Set the Flow for your Catalog Item
