# Example Customizations

This example use case creates a Terraform Catalog Item for requesting resources
with custom variable values passed to the Terraform configuration.

## Change the scope

When you make a customization to the app, ensure you switch to the "Terraform"
scope. This guarantees that all items you create are correctly assigned to that
scope. To change the scope in your ServiceNow instance, click the globe icon at
the top right of the screen. For detailed instructions on changing the scope,
refer to the [ServiceNow
documentation](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/learning-plans/xanadu/new_to_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_buildneedit_xanadu_application_scope).

## Make a copy of the existing Catalog Item

The ServiceNow Service Catalog for Terraform application provides pre-configured [Catalog
Items](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#example-service-catalog-flows-and-actions)
for immediate use. We recommend creating a copy of the most recent version of the
Catalog Item to ensure you have access to the latest features and
improvements. Make a copy of the most appropriate Catalog Item for your specific
business requirements by following these steps:

1. Navigate to **All > Service Catalog > Catalogs > Terraform Catalog**, and review the
   Catalog Items based on flows, whose names use the suffix "Flow". 
   We recommend choosing Flows over Workflows because Flows provide enhanced functionality and performance and are actively developed by ServiceNow.
For more information, refer 
   to [Catalog Items based on Flows vs. Workflows](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#example-service-catalog-flows-and-actions).
1. Open the Catalog Item in editing mode: 
   1. Click the Catalog Item to open the request form. 
   1. Click **...** in the top right corner. 
   1. Select **Configure Item** from the menu.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Configure Catalog Item](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-configure-item.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Configure Catalog Item dropdown menu")
1. Click the **Process Engine** tab in the Catalog Item configuration. Take
   note of the Flow name associated with the Catalog Item, because you need to
   create a copy of this Flow as well.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow Process Engine](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-process-engine.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Configure Catalog Item – Process Engine tab")
1. Start the copying process: 
   1. Click the **Copy** button above the **Related Links** section. 
   1. Assign a new name to the copied Catalog Item. 
   1. Optionally, modify the description and short description fields. 
      Right-click the header and select **Save**.

## Adjust the Variable Set

If a Catalog Item requires users to input variable values,
you must update the variable set with those required variables.
Although some default Catalog Items come with pre-defined example variables, it
is common practice to remove these and replace them with your own custom
variables.

1. Create a new Variable Set.
   1. On the Catalog Item's configuration page, under the **Related Links**
      section, click the **Variable Sets** tab.
   1. Click the **New** button to create a new variable set. Ensure that the
   variables in your new set match the variables required by your Terraform
   configuration.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow New Variable Set](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-new-varset.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Catalog Item – new Variable Set")
   1. Select **Single-Row Variable Set** and provide a title and description.
   1. Click **Submit**. Upon submission, you will be redirected back to the Catalog
   Item's configuration page.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow New Variable Set Form](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-new-varset-form.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Catalog Item – new Variable Set")
   1. Click the name of your newly created Variable Set and create your 
   variables. You must follow the [naming convention for Terraform
   variables](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/developer-reference#terraform-variables-and-servicenow-variable-sets).
   ServiceNow offers various types of variable representation (such as strings,
   booleans, and dropdown menus). Refer to the [ServiceNow documentation on
   variables](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_ServiceCatalogVariables.html&version=latest)
   and select the types that best suit your use case. You can also set default
   values for the variables in the **Default Value** tab, which ServiceNow prefills for the end users.
   ![Screenshot: ServiceNow New Variables](/img/docs/servicenow-catalog-variables.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Catalog Item – new variables")
1. Attach the newly created Variable Set to your custom Catalog Item and remove
the default Workspace Variables.
   1. Return to the **Variable Sets** tab on the Catalog Item's configuration page
   and click the **Edit** button. 
   1. Move the "Workspace Variables" Set from the right side to the left side
   and click **Save**. Do not remove the
   "Workspace Request Create" or the "Workspace Request Update" Sets.
