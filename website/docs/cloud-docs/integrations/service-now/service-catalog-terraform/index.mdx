# Terraform ServiceNow Service Catalog Integration Setup Instructions

-> **Integration version:**  v2.5.0

The Terraform ServiceNow Service Catalog integration enables your end-users to
provision self-serve infrastructure via ServiceNow. By connecting ServiceNow to
HCP Terraform, this integration lets ServiceNow users order Service Items,
create workspaces, and perform Terraform runs using prepared Terraform
configurations hosted in VCS repositories or as [no-code
modules](/terraform/cloud-docs/no-code-provisioning/module-design) for
self-service provisioning.

## Summary of the Setup Process

The integration relies on Terraform ServiceNow Catalog integration software
installed within your ServiceNow instance. Installing and configuring this
integration requires administration in both ServiceNow and HCP Terraform.
Since administrators of these services within your organization are not
necessarily the same person, this documentation refers to a **ServiceNow Admin**
and a **Terraform Admin**.

First, the Terraform Admin configures your HCP Terraform organization with a
dedicated team for the ServiceNow integration, and obtains a team API token for
that team. The Terraform Admin provides the following to your ServiceNow admin:
* An Organization name
* A team API token
* The hostname of your HCP Terraform instance
* Any available no-code modules or version control repositories containing Terraform configurations 
* Other required variables
token, the hostname of your HCP Terraform instance, and details about no-code
modules or version control repositories containing Terraform configurations and
required variables to the ServiceNow Admin.

Next, the ServiceNow Admin will install the Terraform ServiceNow Catalog
integration to your ServiceNow instance, and configure it using the team API
token and hostname.

Finally, the ServiceNow Admin will create a Service Catalog within ServiceNow
for the Terraform integration, and configure it using the version control
repositories or no-code modules, and variable definitions provided by the
Terraform Admin.

Once these steps are complete, self-serve infrastructure will be available
through the ServiceNow Catalog. HCP Terraform will provision and manage
requested infrastructure and report the status back to ServiceNow.

## Prerequisites

To start using Terraform with the ServiceNow Catalog Integration, you must have:

- An administrator account on a Terraform Enterprise instance or within a
  HCP Terraform organization.
- An administrator account on your ServiceNow instance.
- If you are using the VCS flow, one or more [supported version control
  systems](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs#supported-vcs-providers) (VCSs) with read
  access to repositories with Terraform configurations.
- If you are using no-code provisioning, one or more [no-code modules](/terraform/cloud-docs/no-code-provisioning/provisioning) created in
  your organization's private registry. Refer to the [no-code module
configuration](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/service-catalog-config#no-code-module-configuration)
for information about using no-code modules with the ServiceNow Service Catalog
for Terraform.

You can use this integration on the following ServiceNow server versions:

- Tokyo
- Utah
- Vancouver
- Washington DC

It requires the following ServiceNow plugins as dependencies:

- Flow Designer support for the Service Catalog (`com.glideapp.servicecatalog.flow_designer`)
- ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - Script (`com.glide.hub.action_step.script`)
- ServiceNow IntegrationHub Action Step - REST (`com.glide.hub.action_step.rest`)

-> **Note:** Dependent plugins are installed on your ServiceNow instance automatically when the app is downloaded from the ServiceNow Store.

## Configure HCP Terraform

Before installing the ServiceNow integration, the Terraform Admin will need to
perform the following steps to configure and gather information from HCP
Terraform.

1. Either [create an
   organization](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#creating-organizations)
   or choose an existing organization where ServiceNow will create new
   workspaces.
   **Save the organization name for later.**
2. [Create a team](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams) for that
   organization called "ServiceNow", and ensure that it has [permission to
   manage
   workspaces](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-workspaces).
   You do not need to add any users to this team.
   [permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers
3. On the "ServiceNow" team's settings page, generate a [team API
   token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#team-api-tokens).
   **Save the team API token for later.**
4. If you are using the [VCS flow](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/service-catalog-config#vcs-configuration): 
    1. Ensure your Terraform organization is [connected to a VCS provider](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs). Repositories that are connectable to HCP Terraform workspaces can also be used as workspace templates in the ServiceNow integration.
    2. On your organization's VCS provider settings page (**Settings** > **VCS Providers**), find the OAuth Token ID for the VCS provider(s) that you intend to use with the ServiceNow integration. HCP Terraform uses the OAuth token ID to identify and authorize the VCS provider. **Save the OAuth token ID for later.**
    3. Identify the VCS repositories in the VCS provider containing Terraform configurations that the ServiceNow Terraform integration will deploy. Take note of any Terraform or environment variables used by the repositories you select. Save the Terraform and environment variables for later.
5. If using the [no-code flow](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/service-catalog-config#no-code-module-configuration), create one or more no-code modules in the private registry of your HCP Terraform. **Save the no-code module names for later.**
6. Provide the following information to the ServiceNow Admin:
    * The organization name 
    * The team API token
    * The hostname of your Terraform Enterprise instance, or of HCP Terraform. The hostname of HCP Terraform is `app.terraform.io`.
    * The no-code module name(s) or the OAuth token ID(s) of your VCS provider(s), and the repository identifier for each VCS repository containing Terraform configurations that will be used by the integration.
    * Any Terraform or environment variables required by the configurations in the
   given VCS repositories.

-> **Note:** Repository identifiers are determined by your VCS provider; they
typically use a format like `<ORGANIZATION>/<REPO_NAME>` or
`<PROJECT_KEY>/<REPO_NAME>`. Azure DevOps repositories use the format
`<ORGANIZATION>/<PROJECT>/_git/<REPO_NAME>`. A GitHub repository hosted at
`https://github.com/exampleorg/examplerepo/` would have the repository
identifier `exampleorg/examplerepo`.

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

For instance, if you are configuring this integration for your company, `Example
Corp`, using two GitHub repositories, you would share values like the following
with the ServiceNow Admin.

```markdown
Terraform Enterprise Organization Name: `ServiceNowExampleOrg`

Team API Token: `q2uPExampleELkQ.atlasv1.A7jGHmvufExampleTeamAPITokenimVYxwunJk0xD8ObVol054`

Terraform Enterprise Hostname: `terraform.corp.example`

OAuth Token ID (GitHub org: example-corp): `ot-DhjEXAMPLELVtFA`
  - Repository ID (Developer Environment): `example-corp/developer-repo`
    - Environment variables:
      - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAEXAMPLEKEY`
      - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=ZB0ExampleSecretAccessKeyGjUiJh`
      - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2`
    - Terraform variables:
      - `instance_type=t2.medium`
  - Repository ID (Testing Environment): `example-corp/testing-repo`
    - Environment variables:
      - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAEXAMPLEKEY`
      - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=ZB0ExampleSecretAccessKeyGjUiJh`
      - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2`
    - Terraform variables:
      - `instance_type=t2.large`
```

## Install the ServiceNow Integration

Before beginning setup, the ServiceNow Admin must install the Terraform
ServiceNow Catalog integration software.

This can be added to your ServiceNow instance from the [ServiceNow
Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do). Search for the "Terraform" integration,
published by "HashiCorp Inc".

![Screenshot: ServiceNow Store Page](/img/docs/service-now-store.png "Screenshot of the ServiceNow Store listing for the Terraform Integration")

## Connect ServiceNow to HCP Terraform

-> **ServiceNow Roles:** `admin` or `x_terraform.config_user`

Once the integration is installed, the ServiceNow Admin can connect your
ServiceNow instance to HCP Terraform. Before you begin, you will need the
information described in the "Configure HCP Terraform" section from your
Terraform Admin.

Once you have this information, connect ServiceNow to HCP Terraform with
the following steps.

1. Navigate to your ServiceNow Service Management Screen.
1. Using the left-hand navigation, open the configuration table for the
   integration to manage the HCP Terraform connection.
   - Terraform > Configs
1. Click on "New" to create a new HCP Terraform connection.
   - Set Org Name to the HCP Terraform organization name.
   - Click on the "Lock" icon to set Hostname to the hostname of your Terraform
     Enterprise instance. If you are using the SaaS version of HCP Terraform,
     the hostname is `https://app.terraform.io`. Be sure to include "https://"
     before the hostname.
   - Set API Team Token to the HCP Terraform team API token.
   - (Optional) To use the [MID Server](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=mid-server-landing.html&version=latest), 
     select the checkbox and type the `name` in the `MID Server Name` field.
1. Click "Submit".

## Create and Populate a Service Catalog

Now that you have connected ServiceNow to HCP Terraform, you are ready to
create a Service Catalog using the VCS repositories or no-code modules provided
by the Terraform Admin.

Navigate to the [Service Catalog documentation](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform/service-catalog-config) to
begin. You can also refer to this documentation whenever you need to add or
update request items.
