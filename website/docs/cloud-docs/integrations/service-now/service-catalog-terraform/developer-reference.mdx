# Terraform ServiceNow Service Catalog Integration Developer Reference

The Terraform ServiceNow integration can be customized by ServiceNow developers
using the information found in this document.

## Terraform Variables and ServiceNow Variable Sets

ServiceNow has the concept of a Variable Set which is a collection of ServiceNow
Variables that can be referenced in a Flow from a Service Catalog item. The
Terraform Integration codebase can create [Terraform Variables and Terraform
Environment Variables](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables) via the API using the
`tf_variable.createVariablesFromSet()` function.

This function looks for variables following these conventions:

| ServiceNow Variable Name         | Terraform Cloud Variable                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tf_var_VARIABLE_NAME`           | Terraform Variable: `VARIABLE_NAME`                        |
| `tf_env_ENV_NAME`                | Environment Variable: `ENV_NAME`                           |
| `sensitive_tf_var_VARIABLE_NAME` | Sensitive Terraform Variable (Write Only): `VARIABLE_NAME` |
| `sensitive_tf_env_ENV_NAME`      | Sensitive Environment Variable (Write Only): `ENV_NAME`    |

This function takes the ServiceNow Variable Set and Terraform Cloud workspace
ID. It will loop through the given variable set collection and create any
necessary Terraform variables or environment variables in the workspace.

## Customizing with ServiceNow "Script Includes" Libraries

The Terraform/ServiceNow Integration codebase includes [ServiceNow Script
Includes
Classes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/madrid-application-development/page/script/server-scripting/concept/c_ScriptIncludes.html)
that are used to interface with Terraform Cloud. The codebase also includes
example catalog items and flows that implement the interface to the Terraform
Cloud API.

These classes and examples can be used to help create ServiceNow Catalog Items
customized to your specific ServiceNow instance and requirements.

### Script Include Classes

The ServiceNow Script Include Classes can be found in the ServiceNow Studio >
Server Development > Script Include.

| Class Name            | Description                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tf_config`           | Helper to pull values from the SN Terraform Configs Table  |
| `tf_get_workspace`    | Client-callable script to retrieve workspace data          |
| `tf_http`             | ServiceNow HTTP REST wrapper for requests to the Terraform API |
| `tf_run`              | Resources for Terraform run API requests                   |
| `tf_terraform_record` | Manage ServiceNow Terraform Table Records                  |
| `tf_test_config`      | Client-callable script to test Teraform connectivity       |
| `tf_util`             | Miscellaneous helper functions                             |
| `tf_variable`         | Resources for Terraform variable API Requests              |
| `tf_vcs_record`       | Manage ServiceNow Terraform VCS repositories table records |
| `tf_workspace`        | Resources for Terraform workspace API requests             |

### Example Service Catalog Flows and Actions

The ServiceNow Service Catalog for Terraform provides sample catalog items that use **Flows** 
and **Workflows** as their primary process engines.  **Flows** are a newer solution developed 
by ServiceNow and are generally preferred over **Workflows**. To see which engine an item is using, open it 
in the edit mode and navigate to the **Process Engine** tab. For example, **Create Workspace** uses a **Workflow**, 
whereas **Create Workspace Flow** is built upon a **Flow**. You can access both in the **Studio**. You can also 
manage **Flows** in the **Flow Designer**. To manage **Workflows**, navigate to **All > Workflow Editor**.

You can find the ServiceNow Example Flows for Terraform in the **ServiceNow Studio > Flows** (or **All > Flow Designer**). 
Search for items that belong to the **Terraform** application. By default, Flows execute when someone submits an order request 
for a catalog item based on a Flow. Admins can customize the Flows and Actions to add approval flows, set approval rules based 
on certain conditions, and configure multiple users or roles as approvers for specific catalog items. 

| Flow Name                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |

## ServiceNow ACLs

Access control lists (ACLs) restrict user access to objects and operations based
on permissions granted. This integration includes the following roles that can
be used to manage various components.

| Access Control Roles                | Description                                                                                     |
| :---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x_terraform.config_user`           | Can manage the connection from the ServiceNow application to your Terraform Cloud organization. |
| `x_terraform.terraform_user`        | Can manage all of the Terraform resources created in ServiceNow.                                |
| `x_terraform.vcs_repositories_user` | Can manage the VCS repositories available for catalog items to be ordered by end-users.         |

For users who only need to order from the Terraform Catalog, we recommend
creating another role with read-only permissions for
`x_terraform_vcs_repositories` to view the available repositories for ordering
infrastructure. Install the Terraform ServiceNow Service Catalog integration by
following [the installation guide](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform).
