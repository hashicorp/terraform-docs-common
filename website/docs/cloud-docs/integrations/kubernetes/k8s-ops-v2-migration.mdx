# Terraform Cloud Kubernetes Operator v2 Migration Guide

To upgrade the Terraform Cloud Kubernetes Operator from version 1 to version 2, there is a one-time process that you need to complete. This process will upgrade the operator to the newest version and migrate your custom resources. 

## Prerequisites

The migration process requires the following tools to be installed locally:

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## Prepare for the upgrade

Configure an environment variable named `RELEASE_NAMESPACE` with the value of the namespace that the Helm chart is installed in.

```shell-session
$ export RELEASE_NAMESPACE=<NAMESPACE>
```

Next, create an environment variable named `RELEASE_NAME` with the value of the name of the installation for your Helm chart.

```shell-session
$ export RELEASE_NAME=<INSTALLATION_NAME>
```

Before you migrate to Terraform Cloud Kubernetes Operator v2, you must first update v1 of the operator to the latest version, including the custom resource definitions.

```shell-session
$ helm upgrade --namespace ${RELEASE_NAMESPACE} ${RELEASE_NAME} hashicorp/terraform
```

Next, backup the workspace resources.

```shell-session
$ kubectl get workspace --all-namespaces -o yaml > backup_tfc_operator_v1.yaml
```

Finally, we suggest that you set the `applyMethod` of each Terraform Cloud workspace to `manual`. In version 2 of the Terraform Cloud Kubernetes Operator this is the default value, however explicitly configuring it with the value provides extra protection from unintended automatic applies during the upgrade process. Run the following command for each Workspace resource.

```shell-session
kubectl patch workspace <WORKSPACE_NAME> --type=merge --patch '{"spec": {"applyMethod": "manual"}}'
```
## Upgrade the operator

Clone the Terraform Cloud Kubernetes Operator repository.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cloud-operator.git
```

Change to the migration directory.

```shell-session
$ cd terraform-cloud-operator/docs/migration/crds
```

View the changes that **patch A** will apply to the workspace CRD.

```shell-session
$ kubectl diff -f workspaces_patch_a.yaml
```

Patch the workspace CRD with **patch A**. This patch adds `app.terraform.io/v1alpha2` support, but excludes `.status.runStatus` because it has a different format in `app.terraform.io/v1alpha1` and causes JSON unmarshalling issues.

```shell-session
$ kubectl patch crd workspaces.app.terraform.io --patch-file workspaces_patch_a.yaml
```

Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cloud-operator/blob/main/docs/installation.md) to install v2 of the operator.

Next, create a Kubernetes secret to store the TFC API token following the [Usage Guide](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cloud-operator/blob/main/docs/usage.md#prerequisites). The API token can be copied from the Kubernetes secret that you created for v1 of the operator. By default, this is named `terraformrc`. Use the `kubectl get secret` command to get the API token.

```shell-session
$ kubectl --namespace ${RELEASE_NAMESPACE} get secret terraformrc -o json | jq '.data.credentials' | tr -d '"' | base64 -d
```

If v2 of the operator pod fails to start, ensure that each `workspace` object has the `spec.token` value set. To do this, patch each `workspace` object using following command for each Workspace resource.

```shell-session
$ kubectl patch workspace <WORKSPACE_NAME> --type=merge --patch '{"spec": {"terraformVersion": "1.4.6", "token": {"secretKeyRef": {"key": "token", "name": "tfc-operator"}}}}'
```

Review the logs and verify that there are no error messaged reported.

```shell-session
$ kubectl logs -f <POD_NAME>
```

View the changes that **patch B** will apply to the workspace CRD:

```shell-session
$ kubectl diff -f workspaces_patch_b.yaml
```

Patch workspace CRD with **patch B**. This patch adds `.status.runStatus` support that was excluded in Patch A.

```shell-session
$ kubectl patch crd workspaces.app.terraform.io --patch-file workspaces_patch_b.yaml
```

The v2 operator will fail to proceed if a custom resource has the v1 finalizer `finalizer.workspace.app.terraform.io`. If you encounter an error, check the logs for more information.

```shell-session
$ kubectl logs -f <POD_NAME>
```

Specifically, look for an error message such as the following.

```
ERROR	Migration	{"workspace": "default/<WORKSPACE_NAME>", "msg": "spec contains old finalizer finalizer.workspace.app.terraform.io"}
```
The `finalizer` exists to provide greater control over the migration process. Verify the custom resource, and when youâ€™re ready to migrate it, use the `kubectl patch` command to update the `finalizer` value.

```shell-session
$ kubectl patch workspace migration --type=merge --patch '{"metadata": {"finalizers": ["workspace.app.terraform.io/finalizer"]}}'
```
