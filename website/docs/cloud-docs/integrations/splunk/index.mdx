# Terraform Cloud for Splunk setup instructions

HashiCorp HCP Terraform customers can integrate with Splunk® using the official [Terraform Cloud for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5141/) app to understand HCP Terraform operations. Audit logs from HCP Terraform are regularly pulled into Splunk, immediately giving visibility into key platform events within the predefined dashboards. Identify the most active policies, significant changes in resource operations, or filter actions by specific users within your organization. The app can be used with Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise.

## Prerequisites

Access and support for the Terraform Cloud for Splunk app requires audit logging, which is available in HCP Terraform **Plus** Edition.

### Splunk Cloud

There are no special prerequisites for Splunk Cloud users.

### Splunk Enterprise

-> **Note:** This app is currently not supported on a clustered deployment of Splunk Enterprise.

#### Networking Requirements

In order for the Terraform Cloud for Splunk app to function properly, it must be able to make outbound requests over HTTPS (TCP port 443) to the HCP Terraform application APIs. This may require perimeter networking as well as container host networking changes, depending on your environment. The IP ranges are documented in the [HCP Terraform IP Ranges documentation](/terraform/cloud-docs/architectural-details/ip-ranges). The services which run on these IP ranges are described in the table below.

| Hostname         | Port/Protocol  | Directionality | Purpose                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| app.terraform.io | tcp/443, HTTPS | Outbound       | Polling for new audit log events via the HCP Terraform API |

### Compatibility

The current release of the Terraform Cloud for Splunk app supports the following versions:

* Splunk Platform: 8.0 and later
* CIM: 4.3 and later

## Installation & Configuration

* Install the [Terraform Cloud for Splunk app via Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5141/)
  * Splunk Cloud users should consult the latest instructions on how to [use IDM with cloud-based add-ons](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/8.0.2007/Admin/IntroGDI#Use_IDM_with_cloud-based_add-ons) within the Splunk documentation.
* Click "Configure the application"
* Generate an [Organization token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#organization-api-tokens) within HCP Terraform
* Click "complete setup"

Once configured, you’ll be redirected to the Splunk search interface with the pre-configured HCP Terraform dashboards. Splunk will begin importing and indexing the last 14 days of audit log information and populating the dashboards. This process may take a few minutes to complete.

## Upgrading

To upgrade to a new version of the Terraform Cloud for Splunk app, repeat the installation and configuration steps above.

## Troubleshooting

HCP Terraform only retains 14 days of audit log information. If there are connectivity issues between your Splunk service and HCP Terraform, Splunk will recover events from the last event received up to a maximum period of 14 days.
