# ServiceNow Service Graph Connector for Terraform

-> **Integration version:**  v1.0.0

## Overview

Use the Service Graph Connector for Terraform to securely import Terraform Cloud resources into your ServiceNow instance. The ServiceNow Service Graph for Terraform is a certified scoped application available in the [ServiceNow Store]().

The integration is based on the [Service Graph Connector](https://www.servicenow.com/products/service-graph-connectors.html) technology that provides a framework for discovering and mapping relationships between the organization's infrastructure and the ServiceNow configuration items (CIs), and then automatically updating the [ServiceNow CMDB (Configuration Management Database)](https://www.servicenow.com/products/servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database.html) with this information, enabling platform teams to gain a comprehensive view of the resources they support. CMDB is a central repository within the ServiceNow platform, which provides a single source of truth for your infrastructure and offers configurable dashboards for monitoring and reporting.

The diagram below shows how the application connects Terraform Cloud to your ServiceNow instance.

The Service Graph Connector for Terraform integrates with Terraform Cloud in order to obtain the latest information about your deployments, with the Terraform state being the source of data. The application doesn't make any requests to your cloud provider, and therefore doesn't ask you to share any cloud credentials.

### Two modes of import

#### Scheduled polling

The Service Graph Connector for Terraform can be scheduled to periodically poll Terraform Cloud. Depending on the size of your infrastructure and how frequently the state of your resources needs to be refreshed in CMDB, the polling schedule can be set anywhere from once a week to every second.

The scheduled job makes a request to your Terraform Cloud to obtain all organizations corresponding to the Terraform Cloud API token provided to the application. It will attempt to import all relevant resources from all workspaces within each of those organizations. The processing time depends of the number of organizations and workspaces in your Terraform Cloud, as well as the general performance of your enterprise vendor instance. Setting the import job to run frequently is not recommended for big environments.

Access the scheduler by searching for **Service Graph Connector for Terraform** in the top navigation menu and selecting **SG-Import Schedule**. You can change the polling settings and view all previous import sets pulled into your ServiceNow instance using this method.

#### Terraform Cloud Webhook Notifications

As a more lightweight alternative to the scheduled import, you can configure [webhook notifications](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/notifications) for all relevant workspaces in your Terraform Cloud. Webhooks offer an event-based approach to importing your resources. The import is triggered as soon as a Terraform run is successfully completed in the Terraform Cloud.

Webhook POST requests are sent to an API endpoint exposed by the Service Graph Connector for Terraform in your ServiceNow instance. Each webhook request includes an HMAC token, and the endpoint validates the signature using the secret you provide. Learn more about [Terraform Cloud notification authenticity](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/notifications).

Internally, the application uses a scheduled job as a helper to keep track of the incoming webhook requests. You can activate, configure it, and view the history of all webhook imports by navigating to **Scheduled Imports** and selecting **SG-Terraform Scheduled Process State**. By default, the job is set to run every minute. You can change it to run more frequently if you wish to process the webhook requests even faster.

-> **Tip:** Both import options may be enabled, or you may choose to configure only the webhooks or the scheduled import. 

The [setup page](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-graph/service-graph-setup) provides configuration details for both import modes.

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

After the application successfully imports the resources, they are temporarily stored in a staging database table. Subsequently, the import set records are transferred to the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. Search for **IntegrationHub ETL** in the top navigation menu to view and edit the default ETL rules of the Service Graph Connector for Terraform. The application's ETL Transform Map is called **SG-Terraform**.

If you don't need some of the resources to be imported into CMDB, you can deactivate them in the **Select CMDB Classes to Map Source Data** section of the application's ETL record, and they will be ignored during import. Press the toggle switch button on the resource mapping record to deactivate or reactivate it.

-> **Tip:** Run an import before you open the ETL map as the interface requires at least one import set stored in the memory to be able to display the rules correctly. 

## Get started with the Service Graph Connector for Terraform

### Prerequisites

To start using the Service Graph Connector for Terraform, you must have:

- An administrator account on a Terraform Enterprise instance or within a Terraform Cloud organization.
- An administrator account on your ServiceNow vendor instance. The application is not available on PDIs (Personal Developer Instances).

You can use this integration on the following ServiceNow server versions:

- San Diego
- Tokyo
- Utah

It requires the following ServiceNow plugins as dependencies:

- Integration Commons for CMDB
- Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns
- ServiceNow IntegrationHub Standard Pack

-> **Note:** Dependent plugins are installed on your ServiceNow instance automatically when the app is downloaded from the ServiceNow Store.

### Setup

Refer to the [setup page](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-graph/service-graph-setup) for information about configuring the integration in your ServiceNow instance.

### Supported resources

The Service Graph Connector for Terraform is capable of discovering selected resourced from 4 cloud providers:

- AWS
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud
- VMware vSphere

The [resource mapping](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-graph/resource-coverage) documentation contains tables detailing the mapping of objects and attributes between Terraform Cloud and ServiceNow CMDB.

### Destroyed resources

The Service Graph Connector automatically marks the deleted resources as **Non-Operational** in the ServiceNow CMDB. After the destroy run is completed in Terraform Cloud and the application's import job is finished in your ServiceNow instance, the value of the **Operational Status** field will change to **Non-Operational** for all resources removed from the Terraform state as a result of the deletion.
