# Fetch and review configuration versions

Stacks automatically detect when you push changes to your configuration from your VCS-linked repository. Every time you push changes to your repository, HCP Terraform automatically fetches your configuration and creates a new configuration version.

Whether automatic or manual, every time HCP Terraform fetches a new version of your configuration file, it creates a new configuration version, whether you made changes to that file or not. HCP Terraform uses a new configuration version to [plan](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/deploy/plans) how that configuration version would affect each of your deployments.

This guide explains creating and reviewing new configuration versions in HCP Terraform.

## Requirements

To view a Stack and its configurations, you must also be a member of a team in your organization with one of the following permissions:
* [Organization-level **Manage all projects**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-projects)
* [Project-level **Maintain**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#read) or higher

## Create configuration versions

Stacks automatically detect when you push changes to your configuration from your VCS-linked repository. Every time you push changes to your repository, HCP Terraform automatically fetches your configuration and creates a new configuration version.

Whether automatic or manual, every time HCP Terraform fetches a new version of your configuration file, it creates a new configuration version, whether you made changes to that file or not.

HCP Terraform then creates a new plan to roll out that new configuration version to your deployments. Learn more about [reviewing and approving deployment plans](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/deploy/plans).

### Manually fetch new configurations

If you are not already on your Stack’s deployment page, navigate to it:

1. Log in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io).
1. Select the organization that contains your Stack.
1. In the navigation menu, click **Projects** under **Manage**.  
1. Select the project containing your Stack.  
1. Click **Stacks** in the navigation menu.  
1. Select the Stack you want to review.

Stacks automatically detect when you push changes to your configuration from your VCS-linked repository. Every time you push changes to your repository, HCP Terraform automatically fetches your configuration and creates a new configuration version.

If something changes outside of your configuration, you can fetch your configuration manually by clicking **Fetch Configurations from VCS** on a Stack’s **Overview** page or clicking **Fetch configuration** on a Stack’s **Configurations** page. For example, if someone changes resources directly in the AWS console, you can manually fetch your configuration to update your Stack.

## Review configurations

To review your configuration versions, click **Configurations** in the side navigation menu of your Stack.

The **Configurations** page lists the available configuration versions of your Stack. The top-level dashboard lists your configurations and the percentage of deployments that use each configuration version.

Clicking on an individual configuration version reveals more details, including:

* The ID of the configuration version.  
* The latest commit that HCP Terraform based this configuration version on.  
* The deployments using this configuration version.  
* The corresponding plans for each deployment, along with what triggered each plan. Clicking **Quick View** next to a plan lists the differences introduced in that plan.

You can use the **Deployment** filter to filter by deployment name or the **Status** filter to filter by plan status.

### Download configuration data

You can download configuration data from a Stack so you can debug and analyze how your Stack changes over time.  

Select one of the following options in the **Inspect** drop-down to download specific information about your configuration:

* **Configuration event stream** downloads a log file of your configuration’s events.  
* **Provider schemas** downloads the schema of the providers of your configuration version.   
* **Source bundle** downloads the files that HCP Terraform built this configuration version.

## Next steps

The overview page for each Stack contains a chart of a Stack's configuration version and its respective deployment. You can [approve or discard deployment plans](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/deploy/plans) to manage your deployments.
