# Configure a Stack

This guide explains configuring a Stack’s name, description, project, and VCS settings in HCP Terraform.

## Requirements

To view a Stack and its configurations, you must also be a member of a team in your organization with one of the following permissions:

* [Organization-level **Manage all projects**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-projects) or higher  
* [Project-level **Maintain**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#maintain) or higher

## Configure a Stack

You can configure a Stack by performing the following steps:

1. Log in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io).
1. Select the organization that contains your Stack.
1. In the navigation menu, click **Projects** under **Manage**.  
1. Select the project containing your Stack.  
1. Click **Stacks** in the navigation menu.  
1. Select the Stack you want to configure.  
1. Click **Stack settings** in the navigation menu.  
1. Update any of the following settings:  
   * Name
   * Description
   * Project, learn about [moving a Stack to another project](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/configure#move-a-stack-to-another-project).
   * Version control settings, including:
        * Stacks automatically trigger new plans when you push them to your repositories’ default branch. To deactivate this behavior,  uncheck **VCS Trigger Enabled**.  
        * You can also configure Stacks to work from either a branch or tag-based workflow. 
1. Click **Save settings** to apply your changes.

## Move a Stack to another project

To move a Stack, you must have the **Manage all Projects** organization permission or explicit team admin privileges on both the source and destination projects. Moving a Stack may alter or remove access for some teams based on their [project-level permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#project-permissions).

Upstream Stacks must be in the same project as their downstream Stacks. Moving an upstream Stack to another project breaks any downstream Stack inputs affecting future plans. Move upstream and downstream Stacks together to avoid disruptions. Learn more about [passing data from one Stack to another](/terraform/language/stacks/deploy/pass-data).

## Next steps

After configuring your Stack, you can learn more about how to [review your Stack’s deployment plans](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/deploy/plans) or [destroy your stack](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/destroy).
