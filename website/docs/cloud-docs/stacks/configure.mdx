# Configure a Stack

This guide explains configuring a Stack’s name, description, and VCS settings in HCP Terraform.

## Requirements

To view a Stack and its configurations, you must also be a member of a team in your organization with one of the following permissions:

* [Organization-level **Manage all projects**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-projects) or higher  
* [Project-level **Maintain**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#maintain) or higher

## Configure a stack

You can configure a Stack by performing the following steps:

1. In the navigation menu, click **Projects** under **Manage**.  
1. Select the project containing your Stack.  
1. Click **Stacks** in the navigation menu.  
1. Select the Stack you want to configure.  
1. Click **Stack settings** in the navigation menu.  
1. Update any of the following settings:  
   * Name   
   * Description  
   * Version control settings, including:
        * Stacks automatically trigger new plans when you push them to your repositories’ default branch. To deactivate this behavior,  uncheck **VCS Trigger Enabled**.  
        * You can also configure Stacks to work from either a branch or tag-based workflow. 
1. Click **Save settings** to apply your changes.
