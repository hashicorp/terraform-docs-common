# Define Open Policy Agent policies for HCP Terraform

This topic describes how to create and manage custom policies using the open policy agent (OPA) framework. Refer to the following topics for instructions on using HashiCorp Sentinel policies:

- [Define custom Sentinel policies](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/define-policies/custom-sentinel)
- [Copy pre-written Sentinel policies](/terraform/cloud-docs/define-policies/prewritten-sentinel)

## Overview

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Detect Infrastructure Drift and Enforce OPA Policies](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/drift-and-policy) tutorial.

You can write OPA policies using the Rego policy language, which is the native query language for the OPA framework. Refer to the following topics in the [OPA documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) for additional information:

- [How Do I Write Rego Policies?](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.13.5/how-do-i-write-policies/)
- [Rego Policy Playground](https://play.openpolicyagent.org/)


## OPA query

You must write a query to identify a specific policy rule within your Rego code. The query may evaluate code from multiple Rego files.

The result of each query must return an array, which HCP Terraform uses to determine whether the policy has passed or failed. If the array is empty, HCP Terraform reports that the policy has passed.

The query is typically a combination of the policy package name and rule name, such as `data.terraform.deny`.

## OPA input

HCP Terraform combines the output from the Terraform run and plan into a single JSON file and passes that file to OPA as input. Refer to the [OPA Overview documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#the-input-document) for more details about how OPA uses JSON input data.

The run data contains information like workspace details and the organization name. To access the properties from the Terraform plan data in your policies, use  `input.plan`. To access properties from the Terraform run, use  `input.run`.

The following example shows sample OPA input data.

```json
{
"plan": {
 "format_version": "1.1",
 "output_changes": {
 },
 "planned_values": {
  },
  "resource_changes": [
 ],
 "terraform_version": "1.2.7"
},

"run": {
  "organization": {
  "name": "hashicorp"
  },
  "workspace": {
  }
}
}
```

Use the [Retrieve JSON Execution Plan endpoint](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/plans#retrieve-the-json-execution-plan) to retrieve Terraform plan output data for testing. Refer to [Terraform Run Data](#terraform-run-data) for the properties included in Terraform run output data.

## Example Policies

The following example policy parses a Terraform plan and checks whether it includes security group updates that allow ingress traffic from all CIDRs (`0.0.0.0/0`).

The OPA query for this example policy is `data.terraform.policies.public_ingress.deny`.

```rego
package terraform.policies.public_ingress

import input.plan as plan

deny[msg] {
  r := plan.resource_changes[_]
  r.type == "aws_security_group"
  r.change.after.ingress[_].cidr_blocks[_] == "0.0.0.0/0"
  msg := sprintf("%v has 0.0.0.0/0 as allowed ingress", [r.address])
}
```

The following example policy ensures that databases are no larger than 128 GB.

The OPA query for this policy is `data.terraform.policies.fws.database.fws_db_001.rule`.

```rego
package terraform.policies.fws.database.fws_db_001

import future.keywords.in
import input.plan as tfplan

actions := [
	["no-op"],
	["create"],
	["update"],
]

db_size := 128

resources := [resource_changes |
	resource_changes := tfplan.resource_changes[_]
	resource_changes.type == "fakewebservices_database"
	resource_changes.mode == "managed"
	resource_changes.change.actions in actions
]

violations := [resource |
	resource := resources[_]
	not resource.change.after.size == db_size
]

violators[address] {
	address := violations[_].address
}

rule[msg] {
	count(violations) != 0
  msg := sprintf(
    "%d %q severity resource violation(s) have been detected.",
		[count(violations), rego.metadata.rule().custom.severity]
	)
}
```

## Test policies

You can write tests for your policies by [mocking](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-testing/#data-and-function-mocking) the input data the policies use during Terraform runs.

The following example policy called `block_auto_apply_runs` checks whether or not an HCP Terraform workspace has been configured to automatically apply a successful Terraform plan.

```rego
package terraform.tfc.block_auto_apply_runs

import input.run as run

deny[msg] {
	run.workspace.auto_apply != false
	msg := sprintf(
		"HCP Terraform workspace %s has been configured to automatically provision Terraform infrastructure. Change the workspace Apply Method settings to 'Manual Apply'",
		[run.workspace.name],
	)
}
```

The following test validates `block_auto_apply_runs`. The test is written in rego and uses the OPA [test format](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-testing/#test-format) to check that the workspace [apply method](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#apply-method) is not configured to auto apply. You can run this test with the `opa test` CLI command. Refer to [Policy Testing](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-testing/) in the OPA documentation for more details.

```rego
package terraform.tfc.block_auto_apply_runs

import future.keywords

test_run_workspace_auto_apply if {
	deny with input as {"run": {"workspace": {"auto_apply": true}}}
}
```

## Terraform run data

Each [Terraform run](/terraform/docs/glossary#run) outputs data describing the run settings and the associated workspace.

### Schema
