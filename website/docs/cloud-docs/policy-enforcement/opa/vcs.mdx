# OPA Policy Set VCS Repositories

To enable policy enforcement, you must group OPA policies into policy sets and apply those policy sets globally or to specific [projects](/terraform/cloud-docs/projects/managing) and workspaces.

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Detect Infrastructure Drift and Enforce OPA Policies](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/drift-and-opa) tutorial.

One way to create policy sets is by connecting HCP Terraform to a version control repository. When you push changes to the repository, HCP Terraform automatically uses the updated policy set. Refer to [Managing Policy Sets](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets) for more details.

An OPA policy set repository contains a HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) configuration file and policy files.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->
@include 'tfc-package-callouts/policies.mdx'
<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

## Configuration File

The root directory of your policy set repository must contain a configuration file named either `policies.hcl` or `policies.json`. Policy enforcement supports both HCL and the JSON variant of HCL syntax.
The configuration file contains one or more `policy` blocks that define each policy in the policy set. Unlike Sentinel, OPA policies do not need to be in separate files. You use an [OPA query](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/opa#opa-query) to identify each policy rule.

The following example uses a query to define a policy named `policy1`. This query may evaluate across multiple files, or a single file.

```hcl
policy "policy1" {
   query = "data.terraform.policy1.deny"
}
```

Optionally, you can also provide a `description` and an `enforcement_level` property. If you do not specify an enforcement level, HCP Terraform uses `advisory`, meaning policy failures produce warnings but do not block Terraform runs. Refer to [Policy Enforcement Levels](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets#policy-enforcement-levels) for more details.

```hcl
policy "policy1" {
   query = "data.terraform.policy1.deny"
   enforcement_level = "mandatory"
   description = "policy1 description"
}
```

## Policy Code Files

All Rego policy files must end with `.rego` and exist in the local GitHub repository for the policy set. You can store them in separate directories from the configuration file.
