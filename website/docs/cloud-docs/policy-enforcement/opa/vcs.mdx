# OPA Policy Set VCS Repositories

-> **Note:** Policies are available in the [Terraform Cloud Team and Governance tier](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing), and OPA policies are in beta. OPA policies are not available in Terraform Enterprise.

To enable policy enforcement, you must group OPA policies into policy sets and apply those policy sets to one or more workspaces.

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Detect Infrastructure Drift and Enforce OPA Policies](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/drift-and-opa) tutorial.

One way to create policy sets is by connecting Terraform Cloud to a version control repository. When you push changes to the repository, Terraform Cloud automatically uses the updated policy set. Refer to [Managing Policy Sets](/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets) for more details.

An OPA policy set repository contains a HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) configuration file and policy files.


## Configuration File

The root directory of your policy set repository must contain a configuration file named either `policies.hcl` or `policies.json`. Policy enforcement supports both HCL and the JSON variant of HCL syntax.
The configuration file contains one or more `policy` blocks that define each policy in the policy set. Unlike Sentinel, OPA policies do not need to be in separate files. You use an [OPA query](/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/opa#opa-query) to identify each policy rule.

The following example uses a query to define a policy named `policy1`. This query may evaluate across multiple files, or a single file.

```hcl
policy "policy1" {
   query = "data.terraform.policy1.deny"
}
```

Optionally, you can also provide a `description` and an `enforcement_level` property. If you do not specify an enforcement level, Terraform Cloud uses `advisory`, meaning policy failures produce warnings but do not block Terraform runs. Refer to [Policy Enforcement Levels](/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets#policy-enforcement-levels) for more details.

```hcl
policy "policy1" {
   query = "data.terraform.policy1.deny"
   enforcement_level = "mandatory"
   description = "policy1 description"
}
```

## Policy Code Files

All Rego policy files must end with `.rego` and exist in the local GitHub repository for the policy set. You can store them in separate directories from the configuration file.
