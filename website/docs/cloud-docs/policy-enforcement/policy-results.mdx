# Policy Results

-> **Note:** Policies are available in the [Terraform Cloud Team and Governance tier](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing). OPA policies are not available in Terraform Enterprise.

When you add [policy sets](/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets) to a workspace, Terraform Cloud enforces those policy sets on every Terraform run. Terraform Cloud displays the results of policy checks in the UI for each run. Depending on each policy’s [enforcement level](/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets#policy-enforcement-levels), policy failures can also stop the run and prevent Terraform from provisioning infrastructure.

## Policy Evaluation Run Stages

Terraform Cloud only evaluates policies for successful plans. Terraform Cloud evaluates Sentinel and OPA policy sets separately and at different points in the run.
- Sentinel policy evaluations occur after Terraform completes the plan and after both [run tasks](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) and [cost estimation](/cloud-dodcs/cost-estimation). This order lets you write Sentinel policies to restrict costs based on the data in the cost estimates.
- OPA policy evaluations occur after Terraform completes the plan and after any run tasks. Unlike Sentinel policies, Terraform Cloud evaluates OPA policies immediately before cost estimation.

Refer to [Run States and Stages](/cloud-docs/run/states) for more details.

## View Policy Results

To view the policy results for both Sentinel and OPA policies:
1. Go to your workspace and navigate to the **Runs** page.
1. Click a run to view its details.

Terraform Cloud displays a timeline of the run’s events. For workspaces with both Sentinel and OPA policy sets, the run details page displays two separate run events: **OPA policies** for OPA policy sets and **Policy check** for Sentinel policy sets.

Click a policy evaluation event to view policy results and details about any failed policies.

-> **Note:** For Sentinel, the Terraform CLI also prints policy results for [CLI-driven runs](/cloud-docs/run/cli). CLI support for policy results is not available for OPA.

## Override Policies

You need [manage policy overrides](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-policy-overrides) permissions to override failed Sentinel and OPA policies.

Sentinel and OPA have different policy enforcement levels that determine when you need to override failed policies to allow a run to continue.
To override failed policies, go to the run details page and click **Override and Continue** at the bottom.

For Sentinel only, you can also override `soft-mandatory` policies with the Terraform CLI. Run the `terraform apply` command and then enter `override` when prompted.
-> **Note:** Terraform Cloud does not allow policy overrides for [no-operation plans containing no infrastructure changes](/cloud-docs/run/modes-and-options#allow-empty-apply), unless you choose the **Allow empty apply** option when starting the run. 
### Sentinel

Policies with an `advisory` enforcement level never stop runs. If they fail, Terraform Cloud displays a warning in the policy results and the run continues.

You can override `soft-mandatory` policies to allow the run to continue. Overriding failed policies on a run does not affect policy evaluations on future runs in that workspace.

You cannot override `hard-mandatory` policies, and all of these policies must pass for the run to continue.


### OPA

Policies with an `advisory` enforcement level never stop runs. If they fail, Terraform Cloud displays a warning in the policy results and the run continues.

You can override `mandatory` policies to allow the run to continue.
