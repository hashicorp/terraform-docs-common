# Configure a Sentinel policy set with a VCS repository

To enable policy enforcement, you must group Sentinel policies into policy sets. You can then apply those policy sets globally or to specific [projects](/terraform/cloud-docs/projects/manage) and workspaces.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->
@include 'tfc-package-callouts/policies.mdx'
<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

One way to create policy sets is by connecting HCP Terraform to a version control repository. When you push changes to the repository, HCP Terraform automatically uses the updated policy set. Refer to [Managing Policy Sets](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets) for more details.

A Sentinel policy set repository contains a Sentinel configuration file, policy files, and module files.

## Configuration File

Your repository must contain a configuration file named `sentinel.hcl` that defines the following features of the policy set:

- Each policy included in the set. The policy name must match the names of individual [policy code files](#policy-code-files) exactly. HCP Terraform ignores policy files in the repository that are not listed in the configuration file. For each policy, the configuration file must designate the policy’s [enforcement level](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets#policy-enforcement-levels) and [source](#policy-source).
- [Terraform modules](#modules) that policies in the set need to access.

The following example shows a portion of a `sentinel.hcl` configuration file that defines a policy named `terraform-maintenance-windows`. The policy has a `hard-mandatory` enforcement level, meaning that it can block Terraform runs when it fails and users cannot override it.

```hcl
policy "terraform-maintenance-windows" {
 source            = "./terraform-maintenance-windows.sentinel"
 enforcement_level = "hard-mandatory"
}
```

To configure a module, add a `module` entry to your `sentinel.hcl` file. The following example adds a module called `timezone`.

```hcl
module "timezone" {
 source = "./modules/timezone.sentinel"
}
```

The repositories for [policy libraries on the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/policies) contain more examples.

## Policy Code Files

Define each Sentinel policy in a separate file within your repository. All local policy files must reside in the same directory as the `sentinel.hcl` configuration file and end with the `.sentinel` suffix.

### Policy Source

A policy's `source` field can either reference a file within the policy repository, or it can reference a remote source. For example, the configuration could reference a policy from HashiCorp's [foundational policies library](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-foundational-policies-library). Sentinel only supports HTTP and HTTPS remote sources.

To specify a local source, prefix the `source` with a `./`, or `../`. The following example shows how to reference a local source policy called `terraform-maintenance-windows.sentinel`.

```hcl
policy "terraform-maintenance-windows" {
 source            = "./terraform-maintenance-windows.sentinel"
 enforcement_level = "hard-mandatory"
}
```

To specify a remote source, supply the URL as the `source`. The following example references a policy from HashiCorp's foundational policies library.

```hcl
policy "deny-public-ssh-nsg-rules" {
  source = "https://registry.terraform.io/v2/policies/hashicorp/azure-networking-terraform/1.0.2/policy/deny-public-ssh-nsg-rules.sentinel?checksum=sha256:75c95bf1d6eb48153cb31f15c49c237bf7829549beebe20effa07bcdd3f3cb74"
  enforcement_level = "advisory"
}
```

For GitHub, you must use the URL of the raw policy content. Other URL types cause HCP Terraform to error when checking the policy. For example, do not use `https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-azure-networking-terraform/blob/main/policies/deny-public-ssh-nsg-rules/deny-public-ssh-nsg-rules.sentinel`.

To access the raw URL, open the Sentinel file in your Github repository, right-click **Raw** on the top right of the page, and save the link address.

### Example Policy

The following example policy uses the `time` and `tfrun` imports and a custom `timezone` module to do the following tasks:

1. Load the time when the Terraform run occurred
1. Convert the loaded time with the correct offset using the [Timezone API](https://timezoneapi.io/)
1. Verify that the provisioning operation occurs only on a specific day

The example policy also uses a [rule expression](/sentinel/docs/language/spec#rule-expressions) with the `when` predicate. If the value of `tfrun.workspace.auto_apply` is false, the rule is not evaluated and returns true.

Finally, the example uses parameters to facilitate module reuse within Terraform. Refer to the [Sentinel parameter documentation](/sentinel/docs/language/parameters) for details.


```hcl
import "time"
import "tfrun"
import "timezone"

param token default "WbNKULOBheqV"
param maintenance_days default ["Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
param timezone_id default "America/Los_Angeles"

tfrun_created_at = time.load(tfrun.created_at)

supported_maintenance_day = rule when tfrun.workspace.auto_apply is true {
  tfrun_created_at.add(time.hour * timezone.offset(timezone_id, token)).weekday_name in maintenance_days
}

main = rule {
  supported_maintenance_day
}
```

To expand the policy, you could use the [time.hour](/sentinel/docs/imports/time#time-hour) function to also restrict provisioning to specific times of day.

## Modules

HCP Terraform supports [Sentinel modules](/sentinel/docs/extending/modules). Modules let you write reusable policy code that you can import and use within several policies at once.

You can store modules locally or retrieve them from a remote HTTP or HTTPS source.

-> **Note:** We recommend reviewing [Sentinel runtime's modules documentation](/sentinel/docs/extending/modules) to learn how to use modules within Sentinel. However, the configuration examples in the runtime documentation are relevant to the Sentinel CLI and not HCP Terraform.

The following example module loads the code at `./modules/timezone.sentinel` relative to the policy set working directory. Other modules can access this code with the statement `import "timezone"`.

```hcl
import "http"
import "json"
import "decimal"

httpGet = func(id, token){
  uri = "https://timezoneapi.io/api/timezone/?" + id + "&token=" + token
  request = http.get(uri)
  return json.unmarshal(request.body)
}

offset = func(id, token) {
  tz = httpGet(id, token)
  offset = decimal.new(tz.data.datetime.offset_hours).int
  return offset
}
```
