# Run pre-written Sentinel policies 

This topic describes how to run Sentinel policies created and maintained by HashiCorp. For instructions about how to create your own custom Sentinel policies, refer to [Define custom Sentinel policies](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/define-policies/custom-sentinel).

## Overview

Pre-written Sentinel policy libraries streamline your compliance processes and enhance security across your infrastructure. HashiCorp's ready-to-use policies can help you enforce best practices and security standards across your AWS environment.

Refer to the following resources for details about working with pre-written policies and information about the Sentinel language and framework: 

- [Sentinel documentation](/sentinel/docs).
- The `README.md` documentation included with each of the policy libraries.

Complete the following steps to implement pre-written Sentinel policies in your workspaces:

1. Obtain the policies you want to implement. Download policies directly into your repository or create a fork of the HashiCorp repositories. Alternatively, you can add the Terraform module to your configuration, which acquires the policies and connects them to your workspaces in a single step.
1. Connect policies to your workspace. After you download policies or fork policy repositories, you must connect them to your HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise workspaces.       

## Requirements

You must use one of the following Terraform applications:

- HCP Terraform
- Terraform Enterprise v202406-1 or newer

### Permissions

To create new policy sets and policies, your HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise user account must either be a member of the owners team or have the **Manage Policies** organization-level permissions enabled. Refer to the following topics for additional information:

- [Organization owners](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners)
- [Manage policies](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-policies)

### Version control system

You must have a GitHub account connected to HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise to manually connect policy sets to your workspaces. Refer to [Connecting VCS Providers](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs) for instructions.

## Obtain policies

You can use the policy libraries created and maintained by HashiCorp. The libraries are stored in the following GitHub repositories:

- [policy-library-cis-aws-efs-terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-cis-aws-efs-terraform)
- [policy-library-cis-aws-rds-terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-cis-aws-rds-terraform)
- [policy-library-cis-aws-vpc-terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-cis-aws-vpc-terraform)
- [policy-library-cis-aws-iam-terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-cis-aws-iam-terraform)
- [policy-library-cis-aws-s3-terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-cis-aws-s3-terraform)
- [policv-library-cis-aws-cloudtrail-terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-cis-aws-cloudtrail-terraform)
- [policy-library-cis-aws-kms-terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-cis-aws-kms-terraform)
- [policy-library-cis-aws-ec2-terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-cis-aws-ec2-terraform)

Use one of the following methods to obtain pre-written policies:

- **Download policies from the registry**: Use this method if you want to assemble custom policy sets without customizing policies.  
- **Fork the HashiCorp policy GitHub repository**: Use this method if you intend to customize the policies. 
- **Add the Terraform module to your configuration**: Use this method to implement specific versions of the policies as-is. This method also connects the policies to workspaces in the Terraform configuration file instead of connecting them as a separate step. 

### Download policies from the registry

Complete the following steps to download policies from the registry and apply them directly to your workspaces. 

1. Browse the policy libraries available in the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/policies).
1. Click on a policy library and click **Choose policies**.
1. Select the policies you want to implement. The registry generates code in the **USAGE INSTRUCTIONS** box.
1. Click **Copy Code Snippet** to copy the code to your clipboard. 
1. Create a GitHub repository to store the policies and the policy set configuration file.
1. Create a file called `sentinel.hcl` in the repository. 
1. Paste the code from your clipboard into `sentinel.hcl` and commit your changes. 
1. Complete the instructions for [connecting the policies to your workspace](#connect-policies-to-your-workspace).

### Create a fork of the policy libraries 

Create a fork of the repository containing the policies you want to implement. Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) for instructions on how to create a fork. 

HashiCorp Sentinel policy libraries include a `sentinel.hcl` file. The file defines an example policy set using the policies included in the library. Modify the file to customize your policy set. Refer to [Sentinel Policy Set VCS Repositories](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets/sentinel-vcs) for additional information.

After forking the repository, complete the instructions for [connecting the policies to your workspace](#connect-policies-to-your-workspace).


### Add the Terraform module to your configuration 
This method enables you to connect the policies to workspaces in the Terraform configuration file. As a result, you can skip the instructions described in [Connect policies to your workspaces](#connect-policies-to-your-workspaces). 
	 
1. Go to the [module in the Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/CIS-Policy-Set/AWS/latest) and copy the code generated in the **Provision Instructions** tile.  
1. Add the `module` block to your Terraform configuration and define the following arguments: 
   - `source`: Specify the path to the module you downloaded.
   - `tfe_organization`: Specify the name of your organization on Terraform Enterprise or HCP Terraform.
   - `policy_set_workspace_names`: Specify a list of workspace names that you want to apply the policies to. 

   The following example configuration applies invokes the module for `target_workspace_1`:

   ```hcl
   module "cis_v1-2-0_policies" {
      source = "../prewritten-policy"
      name                             = "cis-1-2-0"
      tfe_organization                 = "<your-tfe-org>"
      policy_set_workspace_names       = ["target_workspace_1"]
   }
   ```

1. Run `terraform plan` to view the plan.
1. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes. After running the command, Terraform will evaluate Sentinel policies for each following run of the workspaces you specified.

## Connect policies to your workspace

Skip this step if you [added the Terraform module](#add-the-terraform-module-to-your-configuration) to your configuration. When you use the module, the `policy_set_workspace_names` argument instructs Terraform to connect the policies to the HCP Terraform workspaces specified in the configuration. 

1. Log into your organization and click **Settings** in the sidebar. 
1. Click **Policy Sets** and click **Connect a new policy set**.
1. Click the **Version control provider (VCS)** tile.
1. Enable the **Sentinel** option as the policy framework.
1. Specify a name and description for the set.
1. Configure any additional options for the policy set and click **Next**.
1. Choose the GitHub connection type, then choose the repository you created in [Set up a repository for the policies](#set-up-a-repository-for-the-policies). 
1. If the `sentinel.hcl` policy set file is stored in a subfolder, specify the path to the file in the **Policies path** field. The default is the root directory.
1. If you want to apply updated policy sets to the workspace from a specific branch, specify the name in the **VCS branch** field. The default is the default branch configured for the repository.
1. Click **Next** and specify any additional parameters you want to pass to the Sentinel runtime and click **Connect policy set** to finish applying the policies to the workspace. 

Run a plan in the workspace to trigger the connected policies. Refer to [Start a Terraform run](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations#starting-runs) for additional information.

## Next steps
