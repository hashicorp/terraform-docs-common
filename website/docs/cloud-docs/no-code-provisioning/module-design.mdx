# Preparing No-Code Ready Modules

-> **Note:** No-code ready modules are in beta and available in the [Terraform Cloud Business Tier](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

No-code provisioning builds on the advantages of using Terraform modules, which let you define collections of infrastructure resources that satisfy your organizational standards and help downstream users deploy those resources easily. No-code ready modules further simplify this workflow by letting users deploy the module's resources without writing any Terraform configuration. 

No-code provisioning allows module developers to abstract away the complexities of their organization's infrastructure, enabling a safe self-service workflow. This workflow lets developers provision approved collections of resources themselves without needing to invest time in learning Terraform or infrastructure best practices.

You can enable no-code provisioning on any module once it is in your Terraform Cloud [private registry](/cloud-docs/registry) or enable the workflow on private modules as you publish them to your registry. Module users can then [provision no-code infrastructure](/cloud-docs/no-code-provisioning/provisioning), set the module's input variables, and deploy its resources.

-> **Hands On:** Try the [Create and Use No-Code Ready Modules tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/no-code-provisioning).

You should follow the same best practices for developing a no-code ready module as for a standard module. However, there are a few additional considerations and requirements for enabling no-code provisioning.

## Requirements

A no-code ready module must meet the following requirements:
* Root Module Structure: The module must follow [standard module structure](/language/modules/develop/structure) and define its resources in the root directory of the repository. This structure allows the registry to inspect the module and generate documentation, track resource usage, and parse submodules and examples.
* Provider Configuration: A no-code ready module must declare the required provider(s) directly in the module. This configuration differs from the recommendations for [modules used in written configuration](/language/modules/develop/providers#legacy-shared-modules-with-provider-configurations).

In addition to these module configuration requirements, the auto-apply no-code provisioning workflow requires automatic access to provider credentials. A new no-code workspace must be able to access credentials, either through a [global variable set](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables/managing-variables#variable-sets) or through [remote state data sources](/language/state/remote-state-data) that pull provider credentials from another workspace.  

### Provider credentials

Organization administrators must determine how no-code workspaces access credentials for provider authentication and design modules accordingly.

When module consumers follow the no-code workflow, Terraform Cloud automatically creates a new workspace for the resources and attempts to provision them. New workspaces must be able to access credentials for all providers defined within the module. 

To grant new no-code workspace provider credentials, you can: 

* Create a [global variable set](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cloud-create-variable-set?in=terraform/cloud-get-started). This action automatically grants newly-created workspaces access to the required provider credentials. 
* Expose provider credentials as sensitive outputs in another workspace. You must add additional configuration to the module to access these values through [remote state data sources](/language/state/remote-state-data) and then reference them in provider configuration. This approach allows for more scoped access than a global variable set. 
* Elect to let the first run in a workspace fail and have module users add credentials directly to the workspace after creation. This approach allows for the most scoped access to provider credentials, but requires manual intervention. Users must manually start a new run to provision infrastructure after configuring the credentials.

## Module Design Recommendations

Similarly to a [standard module](/language/modules/develop#when-to-write-a-module), a well-designed no-code ready module composes resources in a way that is easy for others to deploy, offering a level of abstraction for your organization's infrastructure. However, no-code ready modules anticipate less familiarity with Terraform than standard modules, which are designed for flexibility and composition. Keep these recommendations in mind when designing your module.

### Build for a specific use case

No-code ready modules enable the workflows of users who are less familiar with Terraform and infrastructure management. Reduce the amount of technical decision-making required to deploy the module by scoping it to a single, specific use case. 

Designing your no-code ready module with a single use case in mind allows the users provisioning your module to focus on business concerns instead of infrastructure concerns. Examples of well-scoped use cases are:
A module that deploys all resources needed for a three tier web application
A module that deploys a database with constraints on resource allocation and deployment region

### Limit the number of variables without defaults

The no-code provisioning workflow prompts users to set values for the module's input variables before creating the new workspace and deploying resources. We recommend setting reasonable defaults wherever possible to reduce the effort and expertise needed to deploy the module. Remember that the workspace can also access any variable values set through global variable sets in your organization.
