# Provisioning No-Code Infrastructure

No-code provisioning lets you deploy infrastructure resources in a new Terraform Cloud workspace without writing any Terraform configuration. You can create a no-code workspace from any module version labeled **No-code Ready** in your organization's [private registry](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry).

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->
@include 'tfc-package-callouts/nocode.mdx'
<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

> **Hands On:** Try the [Create and Use No-Code Ready Modules tutorial](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/no-code-provisioning).

## Permissions

To use no-code provisioning, you must be a member of a team with [manage all projects permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-projects), [manage all workspaces permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-workspaces), or [admin permissions for a project](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#project-admins). When using [custom project permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#custom-project-permissions), your team must be able to create workspaces, write variables, and apply runs in a project.

## Provider Credentials

Terraform automatically starts a new run to provision no-code infrastructure upon workspace creation. No-code modules contain provider blocks in their configuration, but still require provider credentials for successful deployment. Organization administrators determine how new workspaces should [access provider credentials](/terraform/cloud-docs/no-code-provisioning/module-design#provider-credentials), which may require specific module design.

## Creating a Workspace and Deploying Resources

The no-code provisioning workflow creates a new Terraform Cloud workspace to deploy and manage the no-code ready module's resources. Terraform Cloud automatically starts a run to provision the module's resources in the new workspace. Depending on the workspace's settings, Terraform either automatically applies the plan or prompts you for approval to provision the infrastructure.

To launch the no-code workflow:

1. Click **Registry** in the main Terraform Cloud navigation to access your organization's private registry.

1. Click **Modules** to view the list of available modules in the private registry. You can filter for no-code ready modules in your registry. No-code enabled modules have a **No-code Ready** badge next to their names.

1. Select the no-code ready module to view its details, then click **Provision workspace**. The **Configure module inputs** page appears.

     Terraform Cloud scans the module configuration for input variables and prompts for values for any variables without defaults or undefined in an existing global variable set. Terraform requires values for these variables to successfully complete runs in the workspace. Terraform Cloud performs type validation for the variable values if the module configuration specifies a type.

1. (Optional) Set values for the input variables. If your organization has defined options for a variable's values, these options appear in a dropdown menu. You can skip this step and configure the variables later in your workspace. However, Terraform Cloud does not prompt you for these values again, and your Terraform runs may fail.

1. Cick **Next: Workspace settings**.

1. Enter a **Workspace Name**. The name must be unique within the organization and can include letters, numbers, dashes (-), and underscores (_). Refer to the [workspace naming recommendations](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/creating#workspace-naming) for more guidance.

1. Choose a **Project** for the workspace. Teams with access to the specified project can view the workspace automatically. Refer to [Organizing Workspaces with Projects](/terraform/cloud-docs/projects/managing) for more details. If the specified project contains any project-scoped variable sets, Terraform Cloud automatically applies those sets to the workspace.

1. Add an optional **Description** for the workspace.

1. Select an apply method for the workspace. **Auto apply** automatically applies any successful runs in the workspace, including the initial run on workspace creation. **Manual apply** prompts operators to review and confirm the changes in a run. **Auto apply** is the default option for a no-code workspace.

1. Click **Create workspace**. Terraform Cloud creates a new workspace and starts a run. Depending on the apply method, it automatically applies your infrastructure or prompts you for approval to create the no-code module's resources.

## Operations in No-Code Workspaces

No-code workspaces have a limited feature set because you cannot access the resource configuration. However, you can edit workspace variables and settings, including notifications, permissions, and run triggers. You can use run triggers to connect the workspace to one or more source workspaces, start new runs when you change workspace variables, or queue destroy runs.

### Updating Variables

To change a variable's options after provisioning, go to the **Variables** section in your workspace to see your workspace's variables listed. To edit a variable:
1. Click the ellipses next to the variable you want to edit and select **Edit**.
2. Enter your desired value and click **Save variable**.

Start a new run in your workspace to update your existing infrastructure with your new variable value.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:ncm-update -->

### Module Version Updates

~> **NOTE**: Updating a no-code workspace's module version is in beta.

When you publish a new tag for a no-code module or change the module version made available to the end user, every workspace that is provisioned with the module is notified that an updated version is available on the workspace overview page. Terraform Cloud does not automatically update the workspaces; instead the workspace owner must respond to the notification to update their workspace. Terraform Cloud will prompt them to provide values for any new variables.

To change the version of the module that users can deploy:

1. Navigate to the module in your organization's registry.

1. Click **Configure Settings**.

1. Click **Edit version and variable options**.

1. Choose the desired module version from the **Module version** dropdown.

1. Click **Save**.
