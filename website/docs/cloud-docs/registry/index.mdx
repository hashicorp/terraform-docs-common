# Private Registry

HCP Terraform's private registry works similarly to the [public Terraform Registry](/terraform/registry) and helps you share [Terraform providers](/terraform/language/providers) and [Terraform modules](/terraform/language/modules) across your organization. It includes support for versioning and a searchable list of available providers and modules.

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Add Public Providers and Modules to your Private Registry](/terraform/tutorials/modules/private-registry-add) tutorial and [Share Modules in the Private Registry](/terraform/tutorials/modules/module-private-registry-share) tutorials.

## Public Providers and Modules

[Public modules and providers](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry/add) are hosted on the public Terraform Registry and HCP Terraform can automatically synchronize them to an organization's private registry. This lets you clearly designate which public providers and modules are recommended for the organization and makes their supporting documentation and examples centrally accessible.

-> **Note:** Your Terraform Enterprise instance must allow access to `registry.terraform.io` and `https://yy0ffni7mf-dsn.algolia.net/`.

## Private Providers and Modules

[Private providers](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry/publish-providers) and [private modules](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry/publish-modules) are hosted on an organization's private registry and are only available to members of that organization. In Terraform Enterprise, private providers and modules are also available to other organizations that are [configured to share](/terraform/enterprise/admin/application/registry-sharing) with that organization.


## Managing Usage

You can create [Sentinel policies](/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement) to manage how members of your organization can use modules from the private registry. For example, you can mandate that all non-root modules in Terraform configurations must be private or public modules from your own private registry. You can even require that all of those modules use recent versions with a policy like [this example on GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-guides/blob/master/governance/third-generation/cloud-agnostic/http-examples/use-recent-versions-from-pmr.sentinel).
