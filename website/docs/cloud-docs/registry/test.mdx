# Test-integrated modules in the Terraform Cloud private registry

-> **Note:** Test-integrated module publishing is in beta.

You can configure Terraform Cloud to automatically run tests for modules in your private registry. When enabled, Terraform Cloud will run tests for every commit to the designated branch. This lets you verify that it is safe to publish new module versions.

## Enable testing

If your module uses the [branch-based publishing workflow](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry/publish-modules#branch-based-publishing) and its source code includes [tests](/terraform/language/v1.6.x/tests), you can enable testing at any time.

To enable testing when you publish your module:
- Choose the **Branch** module publishing type
- Assign a branch and a module version
- Under testing, click the **Enable testing for module** checkbox
- Click **Publish module**

To enable testing after you publishing your branch-based module:
- Navigate to the module overview screen
- Click **Configure Tests** to open the **Tests Settings** screen
- Click **Enable testing for module**

## Run tests remotely from the CLI

After publishing and enabling testing for your module, you can use the Terraform CLI locally to trigger remotely-executed tests in Terraform Cloud. This lets you test your module changes using the credentials configured in Terraform Cloud without committing your changes to version control. 

To run your tests remotely, use the `-cloud-run` flag with the path to your module in your private registry. 

```shell
terraform test -cloud-run=app.terraform.io/:ORG/:MODULE_NAME/:PROVIDER
```

## Configure environment variables

You can define test-specific environment variables that Terraform Cloud will use for testing. If your tests provision infrastructure, you must configure provider credentials for the module.  

To add environment variables to your module's tests:

1. On the module overview screen, click **Configure Tests**. 
1. In the **Variables** section on the **Tests Settings** screen, click **+ Add variable**. 
1. Provide a **Key** and **Value** for your environment variable, and if you want to protect the variable's value, click the **Sensitive** checkbox. 
1. Click **Add variable** to save it.

## Generated module tests

~> **Note**: Generated module tests are available in Terraform Cloud **Plus** Edition and are in public beta. Refer to [Terraform Cloud pricing](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing) for details.

Terraform Cloud can generate [test files](/terraform/language/tests) for any private modules that use the [branch-based publishing workflow](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry/publish-modules#branch-based-publishing) and do not already contain tests in their source code. 

To generate tests for your module:

1. On the module overview screen, click **Generate tests**.
1. Click **Confirm**. It will take a few minutes to generate your module tests.
1. Terraform Cloud displays generated configuration. To download all of the test files, click **Download generated tests**.
1. Create a `tests` directory in your configuration.
1. Unzip the downloaded files into the new `tests` directory.
