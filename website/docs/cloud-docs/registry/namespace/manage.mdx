After an HCP Terraform organization claims a namespace, you can configure that namespace’s GPG keys or release your organization's claim on the namespace.

To access a namespace’s settings, navigate to **Registry \> Public namespaces**,  select the namespace you want to manage from the dropdown list, and click **Settings** in the upper-right corner.

### Requirements

The following permissions are necessary to manage a namespace:

* Organization owners or members with ["Manage public providers" permissions](#heading=h.bxeru2g914l6) can add or remove GPG keys.
* Only organization [owners](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners) can release an organization’s claim on a namespace.

### Manage GPG keys

A namespace uses its GPG keys to [sign releases for a namespace’s providers](/terraform/registry/providers/publishing#preparing-and-adding-a-signing-key). A namespace’s settings page lists that namespace’s current GPG keys.

To add a new GPG key to the namespace:

1. Click **New GPG Key**.
   1. This button only appears to those with [“manage public providers” permissions](#heading=h.bxeru2g914l6).
2. Paste the ASCII-armored text for your public GPG key in the modal window, including both `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----` and `-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`.
3. Click **Add GPG key**.

If successful, HCP Terraform lists your new key in your namespace's list of GPG keys.

### Release namespace claim

A namespace can only have one owner. If you want to move a namespace from one organization to another, you must first release the current organization's ownership claim before reclaiming the namespace in another organization.

To release a namespace claim:

1. Click **Release** under the **Release claim** section on a namespace's settings page.
2. Confirm by typing the word "release" and then click **Release**.

After releasing ownership of a namespace, you can [claim that namespace](/terraform/clould-docs/registry/namespace/create_and_claim) under another organization.

## Manage namespace permissions

Organization [owners](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners) can manage a claimed namespace and its public registry artifacts by default and teams with the following [organization-level](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-permissions) permissions can also manage the following on namespaces:

1. **Manage public provider:** Allows members to publish new providers, publish new provider versions, delete providers, add GPG keys, and view public registry providers.
2. **Manage public modules:** Allows members to publish new modules, publish new module versions, delete modules, and view public registry modules.

Note that these permissions are on the organization level, and you cannot scope them to specific namespaces. For example, if your organization has claimed two namespaces, granting a user the “Manage public provider” permissions means a user can access the providers in *both* of the organization’s claimed namespaces.
