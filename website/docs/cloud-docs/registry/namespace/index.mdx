#  Namespace overview

Every artifact in the [public registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) connects to a namespace that matches the name of the GitHub account that published the artifact.

A namespace is a GitHub account that is linked to an HCP Terraform organization. For example, the `iam` [provider](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws/latest) is published by the `terraform-aws-modules` [namespace](https://registry.terraform.io/namespaces/terraform-aws-modules), which corresponds to an [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) Github account with the same name.

You can link a GitHub account's namespace to an HCP Terraform organization to claim that GitHub account’s namespace. Organization members can then manage that namespace's public registry artifacts collectively. Each GitHub account namespace can belong to one HCP Terraform organization.

### Advantages

Every GitHub account that publishes a resource to the public registry has a namespace. The advantages of linking your GitHub account’s namespace to an HCP Terraform organization are that organization members can collectively manage the linked GitHub account’s public registry artifacts and the namespace itself.

Organization owners can manage an organization’s claimed namespaces and specify who in their organization can interact with those namespaces by setting [permissions](#heading=h.bxeru2g914l6) to allow specific members to either “Manage public modules” or “Manage public providers”.

Those with specific permissions can do the following actions under namespaces their organization has claimed:

* [Publish new providers or modules](#heading=h.waiddmuy1pvg) to the public registry under a namespace
* [Publish new versions](#heading=h.cpt7q52jvpxy) of existing public registry artifacts
* [Add GPG keys](#heading=h.bwsf3j1yygbu) to a namespace
* [Resync](#heading=h.bakie0ub9gwi) a namespace’s public registry artifacts
* [View usage metrics](#heading=h.i1bafzjfhlyq) for public registry artifacts
* [Delete an artifact or an artifact version](#heading=h.mnusggg8fgz7)

### The difference between the public and private registry

The [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) is a public interactive resource for discovering integrations and configuration packages. Anyone can publish and consume the artifacts in the public registry.

The HCP Terraform [private registry](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/registry) allows organization members to share modules and providers privately with members of their organization. An organization's private registry is *separate* from its public registry artifacts and workflows.

For example, an owner can publish a new module to the public registry under one of their organization's claimed namespaces. That organization's private registry does *not* automatically include the newly published module. If someone wants to use that new module, they must [follow the same steps](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/registry/add) they do with any other module from the public registry.
