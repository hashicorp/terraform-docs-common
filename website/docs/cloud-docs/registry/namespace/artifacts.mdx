## Manage namespace artifacts

Navigate to **Registry** \> **Public namespaces** and select a namespace from the dropdown menu to see a list of your namespace’s artifacts. This section describes the actions you can take to manage those artifacts.

### Publish artifacts

You can publish new modules and providers to the public registry under your organization’s claimed namespace. The following workflow should be familiar to existing public registry users:

1. Set up a GitHub repository following the conventions and instructions outlined for the type of artifact you want to publish.
   1. For [modules](/terraform/registry/modules/publish), ensure your repository meets the [requirements](/terraform/registry/modules/publish#requirements).
   2. For [providers](/terraform/registry/providers/publishing), follow all of the steps before the [Publishing to the Registry](/terraform/registry/providers/publishing#publishing-to-the-registry) section.
   3. If you haven’t installed the Terraform Cloud GitHub app globally, ensure you install the app in the repository you want to publish.
2. From the **Public namespaces** page, click **Publish**, and select the type of artifact (provider or module) you want to publish.
3. Select the repository from which you want to publish.
   1. If you do not see the repository you want to publish, ensure you selected the correct namespace from the **Owner namespace** dropdown.
   2. If the repository still does not show up, ensure you install the [Terraform Cloud GitHub app](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs/github-app) in the repository you want to publish.
4. If you are publishing a provider, choose a **Category.**
5. Check the box to agree to the terms of service.
6. Click **Publish provider** or **Publish module.**

HCP Terraform then displays a list of all the versions of your provider or module currently in your repository and the status of each new version that the public registry produces. If you navigate away from this page before processing is complete, it continues in the background.

### Publish new artifact versions

You can produce new versions of public registry artifacts using the same workflow as you do when using an individual GitHub account. Add a properly formatted tag (for modules) or release (for providers) to the artifact's GitHub repository. GitHub notifies HCP Terraform that a new version or release is available and instructs the public registry to create a new version of your artifact.

This process usually completes within a few minutes, and the new version appears in HCP Terraform when you click the ellipsis **…** next to an artifact and select **View version history**. New versions are also visible on your artifact's page in the public [registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/) as well.

If the new version creates errors, a notification appears next to the artifact's name on your namespace’s main page. The notification tells you what went wrong with the last tag or release, after you fix the problem we recommend [creating a new tag or release with the problem fixed](/terraform/registry/faq#how-do-i-correct-bugs-in-published-versions).

### View artifacts

On the **Public namespaces** page, you can click the ellipsis **…** next to an artifact to list the available actions you can take on that artifact:

* **View in public registry** links to the artifact’s page on [https://registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io).
* **View downloads** provides the download metrics for the selected artifact.
  * You can see the number of times users have downloaded any version of the artifact, or you can select a single version and see the number of times that users downloaded that version.
  * You can also download a CSV file that summarizes by month the number of times users downloaded each version of an artifact.
* **View version history** lists of the artifact's published versions.
* **Add to private library** adds the artifact to your organization’s private registry.

### Delete artifacts or artifact versions

On the **Public namespaces** page, you can delete modules, providers, and versions of each if you meet specific requirements.

#### Delete a module or provider

To delete a provider or module, one of the following must be true:

* Someone published the artifact less than 48 hours ago.
* No artifact version was downloaded by users more than 100 times.

If you meet one of the above conditions, you can delete a provider or module by:

* Clicking on the ellipsis **…** next to the artifact and choosing **Delete.**
* Confirm by entering ‘delete’ and then click **Delete.**

#### Delete a module or provider version

To delete a version of a provider or module, one of the following must be true:

* Someone published the artifact less than 48 hours ago.
* No artifact version was downloaded by users more than 100 times.

If you meet one of the above conditions, you can delete a provider or module version by:

* Clicking on the ellipsis **…** next to the artifact and choosing to **Delete version.**
* Entering the exact version of the provider or module to delete.
* Confirm by entering ‘delete’, then click **Delete version.**

### Resync artifacts

Resyncing an artifact checks for discrepancies between the versions of an artifact on GitHub and the versions available within the registry. Resyncing then attempts to reconcile any differences by changing versions available in the registry.

If an artifact version exists in GitHub but not in the registry, HCP Terraform attempts to create new versions in the registry. If an artifact version exists in the registry but not in GitHub, HCP Terraform deletes the registry versions that [meet the deletion requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zQNj31FTnN7uZWeYYE9fml_Z4To44nZIUUu1WTQ83mI/edit#heading=h.mnusggg8fgz7).

To resync an artifact:

1. Click the ellipsis **…** next to the artifact you want to resync.
2. Select **Resync** from the list of options.
3. HCP Terraform then lists the versions it intends to create or delete—click **Resync** to confirm.

You can then see the public registry's progress as it performs each operation. If you navigate away from this page before processing is complete, it continues in the background
