# Set up the Azure DevOps Services VCS provider using OAuth


These instructions are for using `dev.azure.com` for HCP Terraform's VCS features. [Other supported VCS providers](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs) have separate instructions.

This page explains the steps required to connect HCP Terraform to your Azure DevOps Services VCS:

1. Create a new connection in HCP Terraform and get the callback URL.
1. On your Microsoft Entra admin center, create a New Microsoft Entra Application. Provide the callback URL and get the application ID, MS Entra Tenant ID and key.
1. Provide HCP Terraform with the application ID, MS Entra Tenant ID and key. Then, request VCS access.
1. On your VCS, approve the access request from HCP Terraform.
1. On your VCS, Connect Azure DevOps Organization to the Microsoft Entra Application.

~> **Important:** HCP Terraform only supports Azure DevOps connections that use the `dev.azure.com` domain. If your Azure DevOps project uses the older `visualstudio.com` domain, you must migrate using the [steps in the Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/release-notes/2018/sep-10-azure-devops-launch#switch-existing-organizations-to-use-the-new-domain-name-url).

## Requirements

Configuring a new VCS provider requires permission to [manage VCS settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-vcs-settings) for the organization.

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

Before you begin, enable `Third-party application access via OAuth` in Azure DevOps Services settings.

1. Log in to [Azure DevOps Services](https://dev.azure.com/).
1. Click **Organization settings**.
1. Click **Policies** under **Security**.
1. Enable the **Third-party application access via OAuth** setting.

## Step 1: On HCP Terraform, Begin Adding a New VCS Provider


1. Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) or Terraform Enterprise and navigate to the organization where you want to add the VCS provider.

1. Choose **Settings** from the sidebar, then click **Providers**.

1. Click **Add VCS Provider**. The **VCS Providers** page appears.

1. Select **Azure DevOps** and then select **Azure DevOps Services** from the menu. The page moves to the next step.

Leave this page open in a browser tab. You will copy values from this page into Azure DevOps in the next step, and in later steps you will continue configuring HCP Terraform.

## Step 2: From your Microsoft Entra admin center, Create a New Microsoft Entra Application

1. In a new browser tab, login to your [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com), click the **Applications** drop-down in the left navigation menu, then click **App registrations**. If you have access to multiple Entra tenants, switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application.


1. Fill out the fields and checkboxes with the corresponding values currently displayed in your HCP Terraform browser tab. HCP Terraform lists the values in the order they appear and includes controls for copying values to your clipboard. Here is an example:

   | Field name                 | Value                                                                         |
   | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Application Name           | HCP Terraform (`<YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME>`)                                    |
   | Redirect URI               |  Choose **Web** from the drop-down and enter `https://app.terraform.io/<YOUR CALLBACK URL>` in the text box      |

1. Click **Register** to create the app.
1. Once the app is registered, click **API permissions** under the **Manage** section from the application overview, click **Azure DevOps**, then add **vso.code** and **vso.code_status** permissions.

   ![Azure DevOps Services Screenshot: Required permissions when creating a new application in your Azure DevOps Services Profile](/img/docs/azure-devops-services-entra-application-permissions.png)

1. Click **Certificates and secrets**, choose the **Client secrets** tab, then click **New client secret**. Follow the instructions shown to create a client secret.
1. Click **Overview** and leave this page open in a browser tab. In the next step, you will copy and paste the unique **Application (client) ID**, **Directory (tenant) ID** and **Client Secret** from this page.

## Step 3: On HCP Terraform, Set up Your Provider

1. (Optional) Enter a **Name** for this VCS connection.

1. Enter your Azure DevOps Services application's **Application (client) ID**, **Directory (tenant) ID** and **Client Secret**. These can be found in the application's details, which should still be open in the browser tab from Step 2.

1. Click **Connect and continue.** This takes you to a page on Azure DevOps Services, asking whether you want to authorize the app. Click the **Accept** button and you'll be redirected back to HCP Terraform.

   -> **Note:** If you receive a 404 error from Azure DevOps Services, it likely means your callback URL has not been configured correctly.

## Step 4: On HCP Terraform, Configure Advanced Settings (Optional)

The settings in this section are optional. The Advanced Settings you can configure are:
- **Scope of VCS Provider** - You can configure which workspaces can use repositories from this VCS provider. By default the **All Projects** option is selected, meaning this VCS provider is available to be used by all workspaces in the organization.
- **Set up SSH Keypair** - Most organizations will not need to add an SSH key. However, if the organization repositories include Git submodules that can only be accessed via SSH, an SSH key can be added along with the OAuth credentials. You can add or update the SSH key at a later time.

### If You Don't Need to Configure Advanced Settings:

1. Click the **Skip and Finish** button. This returns you to HCP Terraform's VCS Provider page, which now includes your new Azure DevOps Services client.

### If You Need to Limit the Scope of this VCS Provider:

1. Select the **Selected Projects** option and use the text field that appears to search for and select projects to enable. All current and future workspaces for any selected projects can use repositories from this VCS Provider.

1. Click the **Update VCS Provider** button to save your selections.

### If You Do Need an SSH Keypair:

#### Important Notes

- SSH will only be used to clone Git submodules. All other Git operations will still use HTTPS.
- Do not use your personal SSH key to connect HCP Terraform and Azure DevOps Services; generate a new one or use an existing key reserved for service access.
- In the following steps, you must provide HCP Terraform with the private key. Although HCP Terraform does not display the text of the key to users after it is entered, it retains it and will use it when authenticating to Azure DevOps Services.
- **Protect this private key carefully.** It can push code to the repositories you use to manage your infrastructure. Take note of your organization's policies for protecting important credentials and be sure to follow them.

1. On a secure workstation, create an SSH keypair that HCP Terraform can use to connect to Azure DevOps Services. The exact command depends on your OS, but is usually something like:
   `ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM -f "/Users/<NAME>/.ssh/service_terraform" -C "service_terraform_enterprise"`
   This creates a `service_terraform` file with the private key, and a `service_terraform.pub` file with the public key. This SSH key **must have an empty passphrase**. HCP Terraform cannot use SSH keys that require a passphrase.

1. While logged into the Azure DevOps Services account you want HCP Terraform to act as, navigate to the SSH Keys settings page, add a new SSH key and paste the value of the SSH public key you just created.

1. In HCP Terraform's **Add VCS Provider** page, paste the text of the **SSH private key** you just created, and click the **Add SSH Key** button.

## Step 5: Connect Azure DevOps Organization to the Microsoft Entra Application.

Ensure that the Azure DevOps organization you intend to link with HCP Terraform is connected to the correct Microsoft Entra app created in Step 2 by following these [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/connect-organization-to-azure-ad?view=azure-devops).

## Finished

At this point, Azure DevOps Services access for HCP Terraform is fully configured, and you can create Terraform workspaces based on your organization's repositories.

### Migrate existing workspaces to connect to ADO Organization with the new MS Entra App

If you need to migrate existing workspaces to connect to ADO organization, go to the HCP Terraform workspaces associated with the Azure DevOps organization via legacy OAuth application, and update the VCS settings to use the new VCS provider created in Step 3.
