# Configuring Bitbucket Data Center Access

These instructions are for using **Bitbucket Data Center** for Terraform Cloud's VCS features.

Configuring a new VCS provider requires permission to manage VCS settings for the organization. ([More about permissions.](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

[Bitbucket Cloud has separate instructions,](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs/bitbucket-cloud) as do the [other supported VCS providers.](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs)

Note that Bitbucket Data Center requires both OAuth authentication and an SSH key, both of which are covered in the instructions.

~> **Important:** Terraform Cloud needs to contact Bitbucket Data Center over both SSH and HTTP (or HTTPS) during setup and during normal operation. For the SaaS version of Terraform Cloud, this means Bitbucket Data Center must be internet-accessible on its SSH and HTTP(S) ports; for Terraform Enterprise, you must have network connectivity between your Terraform Enterprise and Bitbucket Data Center instances. <br /><br /> Note that [Bitbucket Data Center's default ports](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserverkb/which-ports-does-bitbucket-server-listen-on-and-what-are-they-used-for-806029586.html) are 7999 for SSH and 7990 for HTTP; check your configuration to confirm your instance's real ports.

## Step 1: On Terraform Cloud, Begin Adding a New VCS Provider

1. Go to your organization's settings and then click **Providers**. The **VCS Providers** page appears.

1. Click **Add VCS Provider**. The **VCS Providers** page appears.

1. Select **Bitbucket** and then select **Bitbucket Data Center** from the menu. The page moves to the next step.

1. (Optional) Enter a **Name** for this VCS connection.

1. Enter the URL of your Bitbucket Data Center instance in the **HTTP URL** and **API URL** fields.

   ~> **Important:** The values for the **HTTP URL** and **API URL** fields differ depending on whether or not your Bitbucket Data Center instance has a [context path](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/moving-bitbucket-server-to-a-different-context-path-776640153.html) set.

   If your Bitbucket Data Center instance does not have a context path set, the **API URL** should be the same as the **HTTP URL**.

   If your Bitbucket Data Center instance has a context path set:

   1. Set the **HTTP URL** to the URL of your Bitbucket Data Center instance with the context path included, `https://<BITBUCKET INSTANCE HOSTNAME>/<CONTEXT PATH>`.
   1. Set the **API URL** to the URL of your Bitbucket Data Center instance **without** the context path, `https://<BITBUCKET INSTANCE HOSTNAME>`.

   ~> **Important:** If Bitbucket Data Center isn't accessible on the standard ports (for example, if it's using its default ports of 7990 or 8443 and is not behind a reverse proxy), make sure to specify the port in the URL. If you omit the port in the URL, Terraform Cloud uses the standard port for the protocol (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

1. Click "Continue" to view the generated **Consumer Key** and **Public Key** you can use to create a new Application Link in Bitbucket Data Center. Leave this page open so you can copy and paste these values in Step 2.

    To use keys from an existing Application Link, toggle "Use Custom Keys" and enter them into the page.

## Step 2: On Bitbucket Data Center, Create a New Application Link

1. While logged in as an admin user, go to Bitbucket Data Center's "Application Links" administration page. Navigate to the admin pages or go directly to `https://<BITBUCKET INSTANCE HOSTNAME>/plugins/servlet/applinks/listApplicationLinks`.

   This page has a text field for creating a new application link, followed by a list of existing application links.

   ![Bitbucket Data Center screenshot: The application links page](/img/docs/bitbucket-server-application-links.png)

1. Select **Create link** in application links.
2. Select **Atlassian product** as the link type. This option also works for external applications and lets you continue to use OAuth 1.0 integrations.
3. Enter Terraform Cloud's URL in the text field (https://app.terraform.io or the hostname of your Terraform Enterprise instance).

   ~> **Note:** If you connect multiple Terraform Cloud organizations to the same Bitbucket Data Center instance, you can only use Terraform Cloud's main URL once. For subsequent organizations, you can enter the organization URL instead. Organization URLs are the pages you go to using Terraform Cloud's **Workspaces** button and look like `https://app.terraform.io/app/<ORG NAME>` or `https://<TFE HOSTNAME>/app/<ORG NAME>`.

1. In the "Configure application URL" dialog, confirm that you wish to use the URL exactly as you entered it. If you used Terraform Cloud's main URL, click "Continue;" if you used an organization URL, click the "Use this URL" checkbox and then click "Continue."

   ![Bitbucket Data Center screenshot: confirming organization URL](/img/docs/bitbucket-server-confirm-url-2.png)

1. In the "Link applications" dialog, fill out the form fields as follows:

   | Field                           | Value                          |
   | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
   | Application Name (text)         | Terraform Cloud (`<ORG NAME>`) |
   | Application Type (drop-down)    | Generic Application            |
   | Create incoming link (checkbox) | ✔️ (enabled)                   |

   Leave all the other fields blank, and click "Continue."

   ![Bitbucket Data Center screenshot: filling the first page of the link applications form](/img/docs/bitbucket-server-link-applications-1.png)

1. This takes you to another dialog, also titled "Link applications," with three text fields. In the "Consumer Key" and "Public Key" fields, copy and paste the values from step 1. In the "Consumer Name" field, enter "Terraform Cloud (`<ORG NAME>`)." Click "Continue." This takes you to a page on your Bitbucket Data Center instance, asking if you want to authorize Terraform Cloud. Double-check that you're logged in as the user account Terraform Cloud will be using, and not as a Bitbucket administrator.

   ![Bitbucket Data Center screenshot: the authorization page](/img/docs/bitbucket-server-authorize.png)

   If this results in a 500 error, it usually means Terraform Cloud was unable to reach your Bitbucket Data Center instance.

1. Click the "Allow" button. This returns you to Terraform Cloud to enter a SSH key.

## Step 3: On Workstation: Create an SSH Key for Terraform Cloud

On a secure workstation, create an SSH keypair that Terraform Cloud can use to connect to Bitbucket Data Center. The exact command depends on your OS, but is usually something like `ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM -f "/Users/<NAME>/.ssh/service_terraform" -C "service_terraform_enterprise"`. This creates a `service_terraform` file with the private key, and a `service_terraform.pub` file with the public key.

This SSH key **must have an empty passphrase.** Terraform Cloud cannot use SSH keys that require a passphrase.

### Important Notes

- Do not use your personal SSH key to connect Terraform Cloud and Bitbucket Data Center; generate a new one or use an existing key reserved for service access.
- In the following steps, you must provide Terraform Cloud with the private key. Although Terraform Cloud does not display the text of the key to users after it is entered, it retains it and will use it for authenticating to Bitbucket Data Center.
- **Protect this private key carefully.** It can push code to the repositories you use to manage your infrastructure. Take note of your organization's policies for protecting important credentials and be sure to follow them.

## Step 4: On Bitbucket Data Center, Switch Users and Add an SSH Key

1. If you are still logged in to Bitbucket Data Center as an administrator, log out now.

1. Log in as whichever account you want Terraform Cloud to act as. For most organizations this should be a dedicated service user, but a personal account will also work.

   ~> **Important:** The account you use for connecting Terraform Cloud **must have admin access** to any shared repositories of Terraform configurations, since creating webhooks requires admin permissions.

1. Go to the "SSH keys" page. You can click the profile icon, choose "Manage account". Click "SSH keys" or you can go directly to `https://<BITBUCKET INSTANCE HOSTNAME>/plugins/servlet/ssh/account/keys`.

   ![Bitbucket Data Center screenshot: the SSH keys page](/img/docs/bitbucket-server-ssh-keys.png)

1. Click the "Add key" button. Paste the text of the **SSH public key** you created in step 4 (from the `.pub` file) into the text field, then click the "Add key" button to confirm.

## Step 5: On Terraform Cloud, Request Access and Add an SSH Private Key

1. Click the "Add a private SSH key" link. A large text field will appear. Paste the text of the **SSH private key** you created in step 3, and click the "Add SSH Key" button.

## Finished

At this point, Bitbucket Data Center access for Terraform Cloud is fully configured, and you can create Terraform workspaces based on your organization's shared repositories.
