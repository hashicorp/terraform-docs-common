# Manage namespaces

After an HCP Terraform organization claims a namespace, you can configure that namespace’s GPG keys or release your organization's claim on the namespace.

## Requirements

The following permissions are necessary to manage a namespace:

- Organization owners or members with [**Manage public providers** permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-public-registry) can add or remove GPG keys.
- Organization [owners](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners) can release an organization’s claim on a namespace.

## Manage GPG keys

A namespace uses its GPG keys to [sign releases for a namespace’s providers](/terraform/registry/providers/publishing#preparing-and-adding-a-signing-key). A namespace’s settings page lists its current GPG keys.

To add a new GPG key to the namespace:
1. Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) and navigate to your organization, then select **Registry** in the sidebar, then **Public namespaces**.
1. Choose the namespace you want to manage from the dropdown list and click **Settings** in the upper-right corner.
1. Click **New GPG Key**, which only appears to those with [**Manage public providers** permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-public-registry).
1. Paste the ASCII-armored text for your public GPG key in the modal window, including both `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----` and `-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`.
1. Click **Add GPG Key**.

If successful, HCP Terraform lists your new key in your namespace's list of GPG keys.

## Release namespace claim

A namespace can only have one owner. If you want to move a namespace from one organization to another, you must first release your ownership claim before reclaiming that namespace in another organization.

To release a namespace claim:
1. Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) and navigate to your organization, then select **Registry** in the sidebar, then **Public namespaces**.
1. Choose the namespace you want to release from the dropdown list and click **Settings** in the upper-right corner.
1. Click **Release** under the **Release claim** section.
1. Confirm by typing the word "release" and then click **Release**.

After releasing ownership of a namespace, you can [claim that namespace](/terraform/cloud-docs/public-namespace/create_or_claim) under another organization.
