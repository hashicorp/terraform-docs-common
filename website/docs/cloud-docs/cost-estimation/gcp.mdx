# GCP resources included in cost estimation

HCP Terraform can estimate monthly costs for many GCP Terraform resources.

-> **Note:** Terraform Enterprise requires GCP credentials to support cost estimation. These credentials are configured at the instance level, not the organization level. See the [Application Administration docs](/terraform/enterprise/admin/application/integration) for more details.

## Supported Resources

Cost estimation supports the following resources. Not all possible values for attributes of each resource are supported, ex. new or custom machine types.
