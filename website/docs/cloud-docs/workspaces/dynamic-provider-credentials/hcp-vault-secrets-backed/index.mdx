# HCP Vault Secrets-Backed Dynamic Credentials

~> **Important:** If you are self-hosting [HCP Terraform agents](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents), ensure your agents use [v1.16.0](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/changelog#1-16-0-10-02-2024) or above. To use the latest dynamic credentials features, [upgrade your agents to the latest version](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/changelog).

For most use cases, separately configuring [dynamic provider credentials](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials) with different cloud providers works well. However, HCP Vault Secrets-backed dynamic credentials are for those looking for a way to use the HashiCorp Cloud Platform as a centralized way to manage and consolidate cloud credentials management.

HCP Vault Secrets-backed dynamic credentials leverage HCP Vault Secrets' [dynamic secrets capability](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/dynamic-secrets), which allows you to generate short-lived credentials for various providers. This means you can authenticate a HCP instance using workload identity tokens and use dynamic secret capabilities on that instance to generate dynamic credentials for the various providers.

## Configure HCP Vault Secrets-Backed Dynamic Credentials

Using HCP Vault Secrets-backed dynamic credentials in a workspace requires the following steps for each cloud platform:

1. **Set up Dynamic Provider Credentials with the HCP Provider:** You must first [configure dynamic credentials with the HCP provider](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/hcp-configuration).
2. **Configure the desired Dynamic Secrets Integration**: You must configure the desired vault secrets integration in your HCP project (i.e., AWS, or GCP).
3. **Configure HCP Terraform Workspace**: You must add specific environment variables to your workspace to tell HCP Terraform how to authenticate to other cloud providers during runs. Each cloud platform has its own set of environment variables that are necessary to configure dynamic credentials.

Setting up HCP Vault Secrets-backed dynamic credentials differs slightly for each cloud provider. You can configure HCP Vault Secrets-backed dynamic credentials on the following platforms:
- [Amazon Web Services](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/hcp-vault-secrets-backed/aws-configuration)
- [Google Cloud Platform](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/hcp-vault-secrets-backed/gcp-configuration)

## Terraform Enterprise Specific Requirements

### Access to Metadata Endpoints

In order to verify signed JWTs, HCP must have network access to the following static OIDC metadata endpoints within TFE:

1. `/.well-known/openid-configuration` - standard OIDC metadata.
2. `/.well-known/jwks` - TFEâ€™s public key(s) that cloud platforms use to verify the authenticity of tokens that claim to come from TFE.
