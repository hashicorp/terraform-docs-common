# Manually generate workload identity tokens

~> **Important:** If you are self-hosting [HCP Terraform agents](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents), ensure your agents use [v1.7.0](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/changelog#1-7-0-03-02-2023) or above. To use the latest dynamic credentials features, [upgrade your agents to the latest version](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/changelog).

If required for custom auth workflows or to perform auth with providers that are not natively supported by dynamic credentials, you can request that HCP Terraform inject a [workload identity token](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/workload-identity-tokens) into the run environment for usage in agent hooks.
## Configure HCP Terraform
### Required Environment Variables
You’ll need to set the following environment variable in your HCP Terraform workspace in order to have HCP Terraform inject a workload identity token into the run environment. You can set this as a workspace variable, or if you’d like to inject tokens with the same audience value across multiple workspaces, you can use a variable set.

| Variable                         | Value                                       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE` | The desired value for the token’s audience. | Requires **v1.7.0** or later if self-managing agents. Must be present and set or HCP Terraform will not inject a workload identity token into the run environment. |

### Generating Multiple Tokens

~> **Important:** If you are self-hosting [HCP Terraform agents](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents), ensure your agents use [v1.12.0](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/changelog#1-12-0-07-26-2023) or above. To use the latest dynamic credentials features, [upgrade your agents to the latest version](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/changelog).

You can generate multiple tokens if you want distinct audience values for different consumers of your workload identity tokens. For more details, see [Specifying Multiple Configurations](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/specifying-multiple-configurations).

You can generate multiple tokens by specifying additional variables in the following format: `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE_[YOUR_TAG_HERE]`.

Your tag can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores and can not use reserved keywords. The following keywords are reserved: `TYPE`.

Each additional audience variable you specify generates an additional workload identity token that HCP Terraform stores in variables with the format: `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN_[YOUR_TAG_HERE]`.

## Configure Agent Hooks
After you've set the `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE` variable, each plan and apply will have a `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN` variable available in the run environment, which contains a [workload identity token](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/workload-identity-tokens).

You can use this environment variable in custom agent hooks to enable custom auth workflows or to perform auth with providers which are not natively supported by dynamic credentials.
