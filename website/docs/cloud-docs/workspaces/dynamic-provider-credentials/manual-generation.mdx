# Manually Generating Workload Identity Tokens

~> **Important:** Make sure your agents are running version **v1.7.0** or later.

If required for custom auth workflows or to perform auth with providers that are not natively supported by dynamic credentials, you can request that Terraform Cloud inject a [workload identity token](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/workload-identity-tokens) into the run environment for usage in agent hooks.
## Configure Terraform Cloud
### Required Environment Variables
You’ll need to set the following environment variable in your Terraform Cloud workspace in order to have Terraform Cloud inject a workload identity token into the run environment. You can set this as a workspace variable, or if you’d like to inject tokens with the same audience value across multiple workspaces, you can use a variable set.

| Variable                         | Value                                       | Notes                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE` | The desired value for the token’s audience. | Must be present and set or Terraform Cloud will not inject a workload identity token into the run environment. |

## Configure Agent Hooks
After you've set the `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE` variable, each plan and apply will have a `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN` variable available in the run environment, which contains a [workload identity token](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/workload-identity-tokens).

You can use this environment variable in custom agent hooks to enable custom auth workflows or to perform auth with providers which are not natively supported by dynamic credentials.
