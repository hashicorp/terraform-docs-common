# Vault-Backed Dynamic Credentials with the Azure Provider

~> **Important:** If using self-managed agents, make sure you’re using **v1.8.0** or later.

You can use Terraform Cloud’s native OpenID Connect integration with Vault to use [Vault-backed dynamic credentials](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/vault-backed) with the Azure provider in your Terraform Cloud runs. Configuring the integration requires the following steps:

1. **[Configure Vault Dynamic Provider Credentials](#configure-vault-dynamic-provider-credentials)**: Set up a trust configuration between Vault and Terraform Cloud, create Vault roles and policies for your Terraform Cloud workspaces, and add environment variables to those workspaces.
2. **[Configure the Vault Azure Secrets Engine](#configure-vault-azure-secrets-engine)**: Set up the Azure secrets engine in your Vault instance.
3. **[Configure Terraform Cloud](#configure-terraform-cloud)**: Add additional environment variables to the Terraform Cloud workspaces where you want to use Vault-Backed Dynamic Credentials.
4. **[Configure Terraform Providers](#configure-terraform-providers)**: Configure your Terraform providers to work with Vault-backed Dynamic Credentials.

Once you complete this setup, Terraform Cloud automatically authenticates with Azure via Vault-generated credentials during the plan and apply phase of each run. The Azure provider's authentication is only valid for the length of the plan or apply phase.

## Configure Vault Dynamic Provider Credentials
You must first set up Vault dynamic provider credentials before you can use Vault-backed dynamic credentials. This includes setting up the JWT auth backend in Vault, configuring trust between Terraform Cloud and Vault, and populating the required environment variables in your Terraform Cloud workspace.

[See the setup instructions for Vault dynamic provider credentials](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/vault-configuration).

# Configure Vault Azure Secrets Engine
Follow the instructions in the Vault documentation for [setting up the Azure secrets engine in your Vault instance](/vault/docs/secrets/azure). You can also do this configuration through Terraform. Refer to our [example Terraform configuration](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-dynamic-credentials-setup-examples/vault-backed/azure).

## Configure Terraform Cloud
Next, you need to set certain environment variables in your Terraform Cloud workspace to authenticate Terraform Cloud with Azure using Vault-backed dynamic credentials. These variables are in addition to those you previously set while configuring [Vault dynamic provider credentials](#configure-vault-dynamic-provider-credentials). You can add these as workspace variables or as a [variable set](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables/managing-variables#variable-sets).

### Required Environment Variables
| Variable                                | Value                     | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TFC_VAULT_BACKED_AZURE_AUTH`           | `true`                    | Must be present and set to `true`, or Terraform Cloud will not attempt to authenticate with Azure.                                                                                            |
| `TFC_VAULT_BACKED_AZURE_RUN_VAULT_ROLE` | The role to use in Vault. | Optional if `TFC_VAULT_BACKED_AZURE_PLAN_VAULT_ROLE` and `TFC_VAULT_BACKED_AZURE_APPLY_VAULT_ROLE` are both provided. These variables are described [below](#optional-environment-variables). |

### Optional Environment Variables
You may need to set these variables, depending on your use case.

| Variable                                  | Value                                                | Notes                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TFC_VAULT_BACKED_AZURE_MOUNT_PATH`       | The mount path of the Azure secrets engine in Vault. | Defaults to `azure`.                                                                    |
| `TFC_VAULT_BACKED_AZURE_PLAN_VAULT_ROLE`  | The Vault role to use the plan phase of a run.       | Will fall back to the value of `TFC_VAULT_BACKED_AZURE_RUN_VAULT_ROLE` if not provided. |
| `TFC_VAULT_BACKED_AZURE_APPLY_VAULT_ROLE` | The Vault role to use for the apply phase of a run.  | Will fall back to the value of `TFC_VAULT_BACKED_AZURE_RUN_VAULT_ROLE` if not provided. |

## Configure Terraform Providers
The final step is to directly configure your Azure and Vault providers.

### Configure the AzureRM or AzureAD Provider
Ensure you pass a value for the `subscription_id` and `tenant_id` arguments in your provider configuration block or set the `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and `ARM_TENANT_ID` variables in your workspace.

Do not set values for `client_id`, `use_oidc`, or `oidc_token` in your provider configuration block. Additionally, do not set variable values for `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_USE_OIDC`, or `ARM_OIDC_TOKEN`.

### Configure the Vault Provider
If you were previously using the Vault provider to authenticate the Azure provider, remove any existing usage of the Azure secrets engine from your Terraform Code.
This includes the [`vault_azure_access_credentials`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs/data-sources/azure_access_credentials) data source and any instances of [`vault_generic_secret`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs/data-sources/generic_secret) you previously used to generate Azure credentials.
