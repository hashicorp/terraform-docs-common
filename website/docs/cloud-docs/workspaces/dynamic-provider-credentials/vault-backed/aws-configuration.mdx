# Vault-Backed Dynamic Credentials with the AWS Provider

~> **Important:** If you are self-hosting [Terraform Cloud Agents](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents), ensure your agents use [v1.8.0](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/changelog#1-8-0-04-18-2023) or above. To use the latest dynamic credentials features, [upgrade your agents to the latest version](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/changelog).

You can use Terraform Cloud’s native OpenID Connect integration with Vault to use [Vault-backed dynamic credentials](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/vault-backed) with the AWS provider in your Terraform Cloud runs. Configuring the integration requires the following steps:

1. **[Configure Vault Dynamic Provider Credentials](#configure-vault-dynamic-provider-credentials)**: Set up a trust configuration between Vault and Terraform Cloud, create Vault roles and policies for your Terraform Cloud workspaces, and add environment variables to those workspaces.
2. **[Configure the Vault AWS Secrets Engine](#configure-vault-aws-secrets-engine)**: Set up the AWS secrets engine in your Vault instance.
3. **[Configure Terraform Cloud](#configure-terraform-cloud)**: Add additional environment variables to the Terraform Cloud workspaces where you want to use Vault-Backed Dynamic Credentials.
4. **[Configure Terraform Providers](#configure-terraform-providers)**: Configure your Terraform providers to work with Vault-backed dynamic credentials.

Once you complete this setup, Terraform Cloud automatically authenticates with AWS via Vault-generated credentials during the plan and apply phase of each run. The AWS provider's authentication is only valid for the length of the plan or apply phase.

## Configure Vault Dynamic Provider Credentials
You must first set up Vault dynamic provider credentials before you can use Vault-backed dynamic credentials. This includes setting up the JWT auth backend in Vault, configuring trust between Terraform Cloud and Vault, and populating the required environment variables in your Terraform Cloud workspace.

[See the setup instructions for Vault dynamic provider credentials](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/vault-configuration).

# Configure Vault AWS Secrets Engine
Follow the instructions in the Vault documentation for [setting up the AWS secrets engine in your Vault instance](/vault/docs/secrets/aws). You can also do this configuration through Terraform. Refer to our [example Terraform configuration](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-dynamic-credentials-setup-examples/vault-backed/aws).

~> **Important**: carefully consider the limitations and differences between each supported credential type in the AWS secrets engine. These limitations carry over to Terraform Cloud’s usage of these credentials for authenticating the AWS provider.

## Configure Terraform Cloud
Next, you need to set certain environment variables in your Terraform Cloud workspace to authenticate Terraform Cloud with AWS using Vault-backed dynamic credentials. These variables are in addition to those you previously set while configuring [Vault dynamic provider credentials](#configure-vault-dynamic-provider-credentials). You can add these as workspace variables or as a [variable set](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables/managing-variables#variable-sets).
### Common Environment Variables
The below variables apply to all AWS auth types.

## Configure Terraform Providers
The final step is to directly configure your AWS and Vault providers.

### Configure the AWS Provider
Ensure you pass a value for the `region` argument in your AWS provider configuration block or set the `AWS_REGION` variable in your workspace.

Ensure you are not using any of the arguments or methods mentioned in the [authentication and configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration) section of the provider documentation. Otherwise, these settings may interfere with dynamic provider credentials.

### Configure the Vault Provider
If you were previously using the Vault provider to authenticate the AWS provider, remove any existing usage of the AWS secrets engine from your Terraform Code.
This includes the [`vault_aws_access_credentials`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs/data-sources/aws_access_credentials) data source and any instances of [`vault_generic_secret`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs/data-sources/generic_secret) you previously used to generate AWS credentials.
