# Health

Terraform Cloud can perform automatic health assessments in a workspace to assess whether its real infrastructure matches the requirements defined in its Terraform configuration. Health assessments include the following types of evaluations:

- [Drift detection](#drift-detection) determines whether your real-world infrastructure matches your Terraform state file.
- [Continuous validation](#continuous-validation) determines whether custom conditions in the workspace’s configuration continue to pass after Terraform provisions the infrastructure.

When enabled, Terraform Cloud automatically runs a health assessment for your workspace about every 24 hours. Refer to [Health Assessment Scheduling](#health-assessment-scheduling) for details.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->
-> **Note:** Health assessments are available in Terraform Cloud **Plus** Edition. Refer to [Terraform Cloud pricing](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing) for details.
<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

## Permissions

Working with health assessments requires the following permissions:
- To view health status for a workspace, you need read access to that workspace.
- To change organization health settings, you must be an [organization owner](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners).
- To change a workspace’s health settings, you must be an [administrator for that workspace](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-admins).
<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:health-assessments -->
- To trigger [on demand assessments](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/health#on-demand-assessments) for a workspace, you must be an [administrator for that workspace](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-admins).
<!-- END: TFC:only name:health-assessments -->

## Workspace Requirements

Workspaces require the following settings to receive health assessments:
- Terraform version 0.15.4+ for drift detection only
- Terraform version 1.3.0+ for drift detection and continuous validation
- [Remote execution mode](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#execution-mode) or [Agent execution mode](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents/agent-pools#configure-workspaces-to-use-the-agent) for Terraform runs

The latest Terraform run in the workspace must have been successful. If the most recent run ended in an errored, canceled, or discarded state, Terraform Cloud pauses health assessments until there is a successfully applied run.

The workspace must also have at least one run in which Terraform successfully applies a configuration. Terraform Cloud does not perform health assessments in workspaces with no real-world infrastructure.

## Enable Health Assessments

You can enforce health assessments across all eligible workspaces in an organization within the [organization settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#health). Enforcing health assessments at an organization-level overrides workspace-level settings. You can only enable health assessments within a specific workspace when Terraform Cloud is not enforcing health assessments at the organization level.

To enable health assessments within a workspace:

1. Verify that your workspace satisfies the [requirements](#workspace-requirements).
1. Go to the workspace and click **Settings > Health**.
1. Select **Enable** under **Health Assessments**.
1. Click **Save settings**.

## Health Assessment Scheduling

The timing of the first health assessment in the workspace depends on whether you enable health assessments during active Terraform runs:
- **No active runs:** The first health assessment starts a few minutes after you enable the feature.
- **Active speculative plan:** The first health assessment starts soon after that plan's completion.
- **Other active runs:** The first health assessment starts in about 24 hours.

After the first health assessment, Terraform Cloud starts a new health assessment if at least 24 hours have passed since the last assessment and there are no active runs in the workspace. Health assessments may take longer to complete when you enable health assessments in many workspaces at once or your workspace contains a complex configuration with many resources.


A health assessment never interrupts or interferes with runs. If you start a new run during a health assessment, Terraform Cloud cancels the current assessment and runs the next assessment in 24 hours. This behavior may prevent Terraform Cloud from performing health assessments in workspaces with frequent runs.

Terraform Cloud pauses health assessments if the latest run ended in an errored state. This behavior occurs for all run types, including plan-only runs and speculative plans. Once the workspace completes a successful run, Terraform Cloud restarts health assessments after 24 hours.

Terraform Enterprise administrators can modify their installation's [assessment frequency  and number of maximum concurrent assessments](/terraform/enterprise/admin/application/general#health-assessments) from the admin settings console.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:health-assessments -->
### On Demand Assessments

-> **Note:** On demand assessments are only available in the Terraform Cloud web UI.

If you are an administrator for a workspace and it satisfies all [assessment requirements](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/health#workspace-requirements), you can trigger a new assessment by clicking **Start health assessment** on the workspace's **Health** page.

When you click the **Start health assessment** button, the workspace displays a message in the bottom lefthand corner of the page to indicate if it successfully triggered a new assessment. The time it takes to complete an assessment can vary based on network latency and the number of resources managed by the workspace. 

While an assessment is in progress, you cannot trigger another assessment. And on demand assessment resets the scheduling for automated assessments, so the next automated assessment will run in 24 hours. 
<!-- END: TFC:only name:health-assessments -->

### Concurrency

If you enable health assessments on multiple workspaces, assessments may run concurrently. Health assessments do not affect your concurrency limit. Terraform Cloud also monitors and controls health assessment concurrency to avoid issues for large-scale deployments with thousands of workspaces. However, Terraform Cloud performs health assessments in batches, so health assessments may take longer to complete when you enable them in a large number of workspaces.

### Notifications

Terraform Cloud sends [notifications](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/notifications) about health assessment results according to your workspace’s settings.

## Workspace Health Status

On the organization's **Workspaces** page, Terraform Cloud displays a **Health warning** status for workspaces with infrastructure drift or failed continuous validation checks.

On the right of a workspace’s overview page, Terraform Cloud displays a **Health** bar that summarizes the results of the last health assessment.
- The **Drift** summary shows the total number of resources in the configuration and the number of resources that have drifted.
- The **Checks** summary shows the number of passed, failed, and unknown statuses for objects with continuous validation checks.

## Drift Detection

Infrastructure drift means that your real-world infrastructure no longer matches your Terraform state file. Drift occurs when a user modifies resources outside of the Terraform workflow. For example, a colleague may update resource configuration directly in the cloud provider console to resolve a production incident. This action changes the real resource attributes from those tracked in the state file.

### View Workspace Drift

To view the continuous validation results from the latest health assessment, go to the workspace and click **Health > Drift**. If there is drift, Terraform Cloud shows how the real infrastructure differs from the latest version of the workspace’s state file.

### Resolve Drift

You can use one of the following approaches to correct workspace drift:
- **Overwrite drift**: Queue a new plan to realign your real-world infrastructure with your Terraform configuration.
- **Update Terraform state and configuration:** Queue a refresh-only plan to update your Terraform state to match your real-world infrastructure. We recommend also modifying your Terraform configuration to include any new or changed resources. Otherwise, Terraform will overwrite the updated state file during the next apply. Refer to our [Manage Resource Drift](/terraform/tutorials/state/resource-drift) tutorial for a detailed example.

## Continuous Validation

You can use [`check`](/terraform/language/checks) or [`precondition` and `postcondition`](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions#preconditions-and-postconditions) blocks to create custom rules to validate your infrastructure's resources, data sources, and outputs.

Continuous validation lets Terraform Cloud regularly verify whether your workspace’s custom assertions continue to pass, validating your real-world infrastructure. For example, use a `check` block to monitor if your website returns an expected status code. Or use a `postcondition` block to monitor whether an API gateway certificate is valid, while also preventing an invalid certificate's proliferation into newly provisioned infrastructure.

Continuous validation alerts you whenever an assertion fails, so you can change your configuration and avoid errors the next time you update infrastructure.

See [Custom Conditions](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions) for details and examples of adding conditions to your Terraform configuration. For guidance on choosing which custom condition to use, see [Choosing Checks or other Custom Conditions](/terraform/language/checks#choosing-checks-or-other-custom-conditions).

### Example use cases

Review the provider documentation for `check` block examples with [AWS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/guides/continuous-validation-examples), [Azure](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/tfc-check-blocks), and [GCP](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/google-continuous-validation).

#### Monitoring the health of a provisioned website with `check`

The following example uses the [HTTP](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/http/latest/docs) Terraform provider and a [scoped data source](/terraform/language/checks#scoped-data-sources) within a [`check` block](/terraform/language/checks) to assert the Terraform website returns a `200` status code, indicating it is healthy.

```hcl
check "health_check" {
  data "http" "terraform_io" {
    url = "https://www.terraform.io"
  }

  assert {
    condition = data.http.terraform_io.status_code == 200
    error_message = "${data.http.terraform_io.url} returned an unhealthy status code"
  }
}
```

Continuous Validation alerts you if the website returns any status code besides `200` while Terraform evaluates this assertion. You can also find failures in your workspace's [Continuous Validation Results](#view-continuous-validation-results) page. You can configure continuous validation alerts in your workspace's [notification settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/notifications).

#### Asserting up-to-date AMIs for compute instances with `postcondition`

[HCP Packer](/hcp/docs/packer) stores metadata about your
[Packer](https://www.packer.io/) images. The following example postcondition
fails when there is a newer AMI version available.
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "hashiapp" {
  ami                         = data.hcp_packer_image.hashiapp_image.cloud_image_id
  instance_type               = var.instance_type
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  subnet_id                   = aws_subnet.hashiapp.id
  vpc_security_group_ids      = [aws_security_group.hashiapp.id]
  key_name                    = aws_key_pair.generated_key.key_name

  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      condition     = self.ami == data.hcp_packer_image.hashiapp_image.cloud_image_id
      error_message = "Must use the latest available AMI,
        ${data.hcp_packer_image.hashiapp_image.cloud_image_id}."
    }
  }
}
```

This example uses a `postcondition` block to ensure that Terraform can not provision any new infrastructure with an out-of-date AMI.

#### Monitoring certificate expiration with `check`

[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) lets you secure, store, and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, encryption keys, and other sensitive data. The following example uses a `check` block to monitor for the expiration of a Vault certificate.

```hcl
resource "vault_pki_secret_backend_cert" "app" {
  backend = vault_mount.intermediate.path
  name = vault_pki_secret_backend_role.test.name
  common_name = "app.my.domain"
}

check "certificate_valid" {
  assert {
    condition = !vault_pki_secret_backend_cert.app.renew_pending
    error_message = "Vault cert is ready to renew."
  }
}
```

### View continuous validation results

To view the continuous validation results from the latest health assessment, go to the workspace and click **Health > Continuous validation**.

The page shows all of the resources, outputs, and data sources with custom assertions that Terraform Cloud evaluated. Next to each object, Terraform Cloud reports whether the assertion passed or failed. If one or more assertions fail, Terraform Cloud displays the error messages for each assertion.

The health assessment page displays each assertion by its [named value](/terraform/language/expressions/references). A `check` block's named value combines the prefix `check` with its configuration name. Preconditions and postconditions use the named values of their parent block.

#### Precondition and Postcondition roll-up

It is possible to use multiple [Preconditions and Postconditions](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions#preconditions-and-postconditions) within a single resource, output, or data source. When doing so, Terraform Cloud will not show the results from individual conditions unless they fail. If all custom conditions on the object pass, Terraform Cloud reports that the entire check passed.
