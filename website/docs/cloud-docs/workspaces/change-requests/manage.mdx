# Manage change requests

This topic describes how to create and manage change requests. Refer to [Change requests overview](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/change-requests) for additional information about change requests. 

@include 'tfc-package-callouts/change-requests.mdx'

## Requirements

To create a change request you must be a member of a team with one of the following permissions:

* The [owners' team](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners)
* A team with [**Manage all projects**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-projects)  
* A  team with [**Manage all workspaces**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-workspaces)

To view change requests, you must have at least [**Read** permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#read) on the workspace associated with that change request.  

To archive change requests, you must have at least [**Write** permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#write) on the workspace associated with that change request.  

## Create a change request

The first step in making a change request is to specify which workspaces this change request is about. You can use the explorer to query workspace data, then select specific workspaces to assign to your change request. To create a change request, perform the following steps:

1. Open the [explorer and perform a query](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/explorer) on your workspace data.   
1. Choose the workspaces you want to include in your change request using one of the following methods: 
   * Select or deselect individual workspace names.  
   * Select the box in the **Name** column to choose all workspaces visible in the table.  
   * Select the box in the **Name** column to choose all workspaces visible in the table, then click **Select all workspaces from query result** to choose all of the workspaces in this query.  
1. Click **Create change request**.  
1. Write a subject for your change request in the **Subject** filed. We recommend implementing a standard format for change requests to help people processing them easily identify your request.  
1. Write a description for your request in the **Description** field. You can use markdown to format the description. You can preview your change request's text by opening the **Preview** tab.  
1. Click **Create change request**. 

After creating your change request, HCP Terraform notifies you if it has successfully received that request. Depending on the number of workspaces you selected, HCP Terraform may take a few minutes to create the change request.

## View change requests

Open a workspace and select **Change requests** from the side navigation to display a list of that workspace's active change requests. You can view the full description of a change request by clicking on that request. If someone creates a change request on multiple workspaces, each workspace has its own independent copy of that change request.

The table for active change requests displays the following attributes for each request:

* Subject  
* Description  
* Creation date and time

Opening the **Archived** tab displays the archived change requests for this workspace. The table for archived change requests displays the following attributes for each request:

* Subject  
* Description  
* Date the request was archived

You can find who archived a particular change request by clicking that request and viewing the expanded details.

## Archive existing change requests

Once you have completed the requested actions on a workspace, you can archive a change request to reflect its completion. Each workspace has its own independent copy of a change request, so archiving a change request on one workspace does not affect the affiliated change request on others. 

To archive a change request in a workspace, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to a workspace’s **Change requests** page.  
1. Click on the ellipsis menu next to a change request.  
1. Click **Archive**.

You can also archive a change request by navigating to a workspace’s **Change requests** page, opening an individual change request, and clicking **Archive**.
