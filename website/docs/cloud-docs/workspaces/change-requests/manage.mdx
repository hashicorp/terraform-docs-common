# Manage change requests

You can use change requests as a backlog of the tasks a workspace requires, often to ensure that your workspaces keep up with your company's compliance and best practices. When someone completes a change request, they can archive it to reflect its completion. 

@include 'tfc-package-callouts/change-requests.mdx'

## Create a change request

To create a change request you must be a member of a team with one of the following permissions:

* The [owners' team](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners)
* A team with [**Manage all projects**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-projects)  
* A  team with [**Manage all workspaces**](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-workspaces)

The first step in making a change request is to specify which workspaces this change request is about. You can use the explorer to query workspace data, then select specific workspaces to assign to your change request.

To create a change request, perform the following steps:

1. Open the [explorer and perform a query](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/explorer) on your workspace data.   
1. Once in the query table, select the workspaces you want to include in your change request. You can select or unselect workspaces by checking the boxes next to:  
   * Individual workspace names.  
   * The **Name** column, selecting all of the workspaces currently visible in the table.  
   * The **Name** column, selecting all of the workspaces currently visible in the table, then clicking **Select all workspaces from query result** to choose all of the workspaces in this query.  
1. Click **Create change request**.  
1. Write an easy-to-identify **Subject** for your change request.  
1. Write a **Description** using Markdown about what your change request entails. You can preview your change request's text by opening the **Preview** tab.  
1. Click **Create change request**. 

After creating your change request, HCP Terraform will notify you if it has successfully received that request. Depending on the number of workspaces you selected, HCP Terraform may take a few minutes to create the change request.

## View change requests

To view change requests, you must have at least [**Read** permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#read) on the workspace associated with that change request.  

Open a workspace and select **Change requests** from the side navigation to display a list of that workspace's active change requests. You can view the full description of a change request by clicking on that request. If someone creates a change request on multiple workspaces, each workspace has its own independent copy of that change request.

The table for active change requests displays the following attributes for each request:

* Subject  
* Description  
* Creation date and time

Opening the **Archived** tab displays the archived change requests for this workspace. The table for archived change requests displays the following attributes for each request:

* Subject  
* Description  
* Date the request was archived

You can find who archived a particular change request by clicking that request and viewing the expanded details.

### Archive existing change requests

Once you have completed the requested actions on a workspace, you can archive a change request to reflect its completion. Each workspace has its own independent copy of a change request, so archiving a change request on one workspace does not affect the affiliated change request on others. 

To archive change requests, you must have at least [**Write** permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#write) on the workspace associated with that change request.  

To archive a change request in a workspace, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to a workspace’s **Change requests** page.  
1. Click on the ellipsis menu next to a change request.  
1. Click **Archive**.

You can also archive a change request by navigating to a workspace’s **Change requests** page, opening an individual change request, and clicking **Archive**.
