# Terraform State in Terraform Cloud

Each Terraform Cloud workspace has its own separate state data, used for runs within that workspace.

-> **API:** See the [State Versions API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/state-versions).

## State Usage in Terraform Runs

In [remote runs](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations), Terraform Cloud automatically configures Terraform to use the workspace's state; the Terraform configuration does not need an explicit backend configuration. (If a backend configuration is present, it will be overridden.)

In local runs (available for workspaces whose execution mode setting is set to "local"), you can use a workspace's state by configuring the [CLI integration](/terraform/cli/cloud) and authenticating with a user token that has permission to read and write state versions for the relevant workspace. When using a Terraform configuration that references outputs from another workspace, the authentication token must also have permission to read state outputs for that workspace. ([More about permissions.](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:intermediate-state -->

During a Terraform Cloud run, Terraform incrementally creates intermediate state versions and marks them as finalized once it uploads the state content.

When a workspace is unlocked, Terraform Cloud selects the latest state and sets it as the current state version, deletes all other intermediate state versions that were saved as recovery snapshots for the duration of the lock, and discards all pending intermediate state versions that were superseded by newer state versions.

## State Versions

In addition to the current state, Terraform Cloud retains historical state versions, which can be used to analyze infrastructure changes over time.

You can view a workspace's state versions from its **States** tab. Each state in the list indicates which run and which VCS commit (if applicable) it was associated with. Click a state in the list for more details, including a diff against the previous state and a link to the raw state file.

## Managed Resources Count

-> **Note:** A managed resources count for each organization is available in your organization's settings.

Your organization’s managed resource count helps you understand the number of infrastructure resources that Terraform Cloud manages across all your workspaces.

Terraform Cloud reads all the workspaces’ state files to determine the total number of managed resources. Each [resource](/terraform/language/resources/syntax) in the state equals one managed resource. Terraform Cloud includes resources in modules and each resource instance created with the `count` or `for_each` meta-arguments. For example, `"aws_instance" "servers" { count = 10 }` creates ten separate managed resources in state. Terraform Cloud does not include [data sources](/terraform/language/data-sources) in the count.

### Examples - Managed Resources

The following Terraform state excerpt describes a  `random` resource. Terraform Cloud counts  `random` as one managed resource because `“mode”: “managed”`.

```json
"resources": [
{
      "mode": "managed",
      "type": "random_pet",
      "name": "random",
      "provider": "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random\"]",
      "instances": [
        {
          "schema_version": 0,
          "attributes": {
            "id": "puma",
            "keepers": null,
            "length": 1,
            "prefix": null,
            "separator": "-"
          },
          "sensitive_attributes": []
        }
      ]
    }
]
```

A single resource configuration block can describe multiple resource instances with the [`count`](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) or [`for_each`](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) meta-arguments. Each of these instances counts as a managed resource.

The following example shows a Terraform state excerpt with 2 instances of a `aws_subnet` resource. Terraform Cloud counts each instance of `aws_subnet` as a separate managed resource.

```json
{
      "module": "module.vpc",
      "mode": "managed",
      "type": "aws_subnet",
      "name": "public",
      "provider": "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws\"]",

### Example - Excluded Data Source

The following Terraform state excerpt describes a `aws_availability_zones` data source. Terraform Cloud does not include `aws_availability_zones` in the managed resource count because `”mode”: “data”`.

```json
 "resources": [
    {
      "mode": "data",
      "type": "aws_availability_zones",
      "name": "available",
      "provider": "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws\"]",
      "instances": [
        {
          "schema_version": 0,
          "attributes": {
            "all_availability_zones": null,
            "exclude_names": null,
            "exclude_zone_ids": null,
            "filter": null,
            "group_names": [
              "us-east-2"
            ],
            "id": "us-east-2",
            "names": [
              "us-east-2a",
              "us-east-2b",
              "us-east-2c"
            ],
            "state": null,
            "zone_ids": [
              "use2-az1",
              "use2-az2",
              "use2-az3"
            ]
          },
          "sensitive_attributes": []
        }
      ]
     }
   ]
```

## State Manipulation

Certain tasks (including importing resources, tainting resources, moving or renaming existing resources to match a changed configuration, and more) may require modifying Terraform state outside the context of a run, depending on which version of Terraform your Terraform Cloud workspace is configured to use.

Newer Terraform features like [`moved` blocks](/terraform/language/modules/develop/refactoring), [`import` blocks](/terraform/language/import), and the [`replace` option](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/modes-and-options#replacing-selected-resources) allow you to accomplish these tasks using the usual plan and apply workflow. However, if the Terraform version you're using doesn't support these features, you may need to fall back to manual state manipulation.

Manual state manipulation in Terraform Cloud workspaces, with the exception of [rolling back to a previous state version](#rolling-back-to-a-previous-state), requires the use of Terraform CLI, using the same commands as would be used in a local workflow (`terraform import`, `terraform taint`, etc.). To manipulate state, you must configure the [CLI integration](/terraform/cli/cloud) and authenticate with a user token that has permission to read and write state versions for the relevant workspace. ([More about permissions.](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

### Rolling Back to a Previous State

You can rollback to a previous, known good state version using the Terraform Cloud UI. Navigate to the state you want to rollback to and click the **Advanced** toggle button. This option requires that you have access to create new state and that you lock the workspace. It works by duplicating the state that you specify and making it the workspace's current state version. The workspace remains locked. To undo the rollback operation, rollback to the state version that was previously the latest state.

-> **Note:** You can rollback to any prior state, but you should use caution because replacing state improperly can result in orphaned or duplicated infrastructure resources. This feature is provided as a convenient alternative to manually downloading older state and using state manipulation commands in the CLI to push it to Terraform Cloud.

## Accessing State from Other Workspaces

-> **Note:** Provider-specific [data sources](/terraform/language/data-sources) are usually the most resilient way to share information between separate Terraform configurations. `terraform_remote_state` is more flexible, but we recommend using specialized data sources whenever it is convenient to do so.

Terraform's built-in [`terraform_remote_state` data source](/terraform/language/state/remote-state-data) lets you share arbitrary information between configurations via root module [outputs](/terraform/language/values/outputs).

Terraform Cloud automatically manages API credentials for `terraform_remote_state` access during [runs managed by Terraform Cloud](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations#remote-operations). This means you do not usually need to include an API token in a `terraform_remote_state` data source's configuration.

## Upgrading State

You can upgrade a workspace's state version to a new Terraform version without making any configuration changes. To upgrade, we recommend the following steps:

1.  Run a [speculative plan](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/ui#testing-terraform-upgrades-with-speculative-plans) to test whether your configuration is compatible with the new Terraform version. You can run speculative plans with a Terraform version that is different than the one currently selected for the workspace.
1.  Select **Settings > General** and select the desired new **Terraform Version**.
1.  Click **+ New run** and then select **Allow empty apply** as the run type. An [empty apply](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/modes-and-options#allow-empty-apply) allows Terraform to apply a plan that produces no infrastructure changes. Terraform upgrades the state file version during the apply process.

-> **Note:** If the desired Terraform version is incompatible with a workspace's existing state version, the run fails and Terraform Cloud prompts you to run an apply with a compatible version first. Refer to the [Terraform upgrade guides](/terraform/language/upgrade-guides) for details about upgrading between versions.

### Remote State Access Controls

Remote state access between workspaces is subject to access controls:

- Only workspaces within the same organization can access each other's state.
- The workspace whose state is being read must be configured to allow that access. State access permissions are configured on a workspace's [general settings page](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings). There are two ways a workspace can allow access:
  - Globally, to all workspaces within the same organization.
  - Selectively, to a list of specific approved workspaces.

By default, new workspaces in Terraform Cloud do not allow other workspaces to access their state. We recommend that you follow the principle of least privilege and only enable state access between workspaces that specifically need information from each other.

-> **Note:** The default access permissions for new workspaces in Terraform Cloud changed in April 2021. Workspaces created before this change defaulted to allowing global access within their organization. These workspaces can be changed to more restrictive access at any time on their [general settings page](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings). Terraform Enterprise administrators can choose whether new workspaces on their instances default to global access or selective access.

### Data Source Configuration

To configure a `tfe_outputs` data source that references a Terraform Cloud workspace, specify the organization and workspace in the `config` argument.

You must still properly configure the `tfe` provider with a valid authentication token and correct permissions to Terraform Cloud.

```hcl
data "tfe_outputs" "vpc" {
  config = {
    organization = "example_corp"
    workspaces = {
      name = "vpc-prod"
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "redis_server" {
  # Terraform 0.12 and later: use the "values.<OUTPUT NAME>" attribute
  subnet_id = data.tfe_outputs.vpc.values.subnet_id
}
```
-> **Note:** Remote state access controls do not apply when using the `tfe_outputs` data source.
