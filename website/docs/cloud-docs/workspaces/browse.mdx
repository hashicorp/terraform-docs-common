# Browse workspaces

This topic describes how to use browse, sort, and filter workspaces in the UI so that you can track consumption across your organizations.

## Overview

HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise include several interfaces for browsing, sorting, and filtering resource data so that you can effectively manage workspaces and projects. You can also use interfaces together, such as applying a tag filter and sorting by workspace name, to refine results.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:explorer-callout -->
### Explorer view
The explorer for workspace visibility surfaces a wider range of valuable information from across your workspaces. Refer to [Explorer for workspace visibility](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/explorer) for additional information.
<!-- END: TFC:only name:explorer-callout -->

## Requirements

You must be a member of a team with the **Read** permissions enabled for Terraform runs to view workspaces associated with the run. Refer to the [permissions reference](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions) for additional information.

If your organization contains many workspaces, you can use the filter tools at the top of the list to find the workspaces you are interested in.

## Find a workspace

1. Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) or Terraform Enterprise and select your organization.
1. Click **Workspaces** to view workspaces you have access to.
1. To view projects you have access to, click on either **Projects** in the sidebar menu or the drawer icon in the **Workspaces** bar.
1. If your organization contains several workspaces or projects, you can paginate through the workspace screen or project drawer to find the workspace you are looking for.
1. You can also use the search bar in the **Workspace** drawer to find a project by name


## Filter workspaces

You can use the following interfaces to sort and filter workspaces:

- Click on a run status button to filter workspaces by one of the most common run statuses. You can filter by one of the following statuses:

    - Needs attention
    - Errored
    - Running
    - On hold
    - Applied

- Choose one or more tag keys, values, or key-value pairs from the **Tags** drop-down to filter workspaces by tag.
- Choose one or more run statuses from the **Status** drop-down to filter workspaces by run status. The **Status** drop-down lists all available run statuses, including the common statuses available in the run status button bar.
- The tag filter shows a list of tags added to all workspaces, limited to the first 1,000 tags alphabetically. Choosing one or more will show only workspaces tagged with all of the chosen tags.
-  Choose a health assessment label form the **Health** drop-down to filter workspaces according to the latest health assessment results. You can filter according to the following labels:

    - Drifted
    - Health error
    - Check failed

## Sort workspaces

Click on a column header to sort workspaces by trait. Traits appear in either ascending or descending alphabetical order. You can sort according to the following traits:

- Workspace name
- Run status
- Repository
- Latest change
- Tag
