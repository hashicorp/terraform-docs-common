# Run Triggers

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Connect Workspaces with Run Triggers](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cloud-run-triggers?in=terraform/cloud&utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial.

Terraform Cloud provides a way to connect your workspace to one or more workspaces within your organization, known as "source workspaces". These connections, called run triggers, allow runs to queue automatically in your workspace on successful apply of runs in any of the source workspaces. You can connect each workspace to up to 20 source workspaces.

Run triggers are designed for workspaces that rely on information or infrastructure produced by other workspaces. If a Terraform configuration uses [data sources](/language/data-sources) to read values that might be changed by another workspace, run triggers let you explicitly specify that external dependency.

-> **API:** See the [Run Triggers APIs](/cloud-docs/api-docs/run-triggers).

## Viewing and Managing Run Triggers

To add or delete a run trigger, navigate to the desired workspace and choose "Run Triggers" from the "Settings" menu:

This takes you to the run triggers settings page, which shows any existing run triggers. Configuring run triggers requires admin access to the workspace. ([More about permissions.](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions)) Admins are able to delete any of their workspaceâ€™s run triggers from this page.

## Creating a Run Trigger

Creating run triggers requires admin access to the workspace. You must also have permission to read runs for the source workspace you wish to connect to. ([More about permissions.](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

Under the "Source Workspaces" section, select the workspace you would like to connect as your source and click "Add workspace". You now have a run trigger established with your source workspace. Any run from that source workspace which applies successfully will now cause a new run to be queued in your workspace.

-> **Note:** Runs initiated in your workspace as the result of a run trigger connection to a source workspace will not auto-apply, regardless of your [auto-apply](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#auto-apply-and-manual-apply) setting selection. You will need to manually apply these runs.

## Interacting with Run Triggers

Runs which are queued in your workspace through a run trigger will include extra information in their run details section. This includes links to the source workspace and the successfully applied run that activated the run trigger.

The source workspace includes a message in the [plan](/docs/glossary#plan-noun-1-) and [apply](/docs/glossary#apply-noun-) run details that specifies the workspaces where Terraform Cloud automatically starts a run. 

## Using a Remote State Data Source

A common way to share information between workspaces is the [`terraform_remote_state` data source](/language/state/remote-state-data), which allows a Terraform configuration to access a source workspace's root-level [outputs](/language/values/outputs).

Before other workspaces can read the outputs of a workspace, it must be configured to allow access. For more information about cross-workspace state access in Terraform Cloud, see [Terraform State in Terraform Cloud](/cloud-docs/workspaces/state).

~> **Important:** We recommend using the [`tfe_outputs` data source](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/data-sources/outputs) in the [Terraform Cloud/Enterprise Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs) to access remote state outputs in Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise. The `tfe_outputs` data source is more secure because it does not require full access to workspace state to fetch outputs.
