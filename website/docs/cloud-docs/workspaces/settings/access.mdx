# Manage access to workspaces

HCP Terraform workspaces can only be accessed by users with the correct permissions. You can manage permissions for a workspace on a per-team basis.

Teams with [admin access](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions) on a workspace can manage permissions for other teams on that workspace. Since newly created workspaces don't have any team permissions configured, the initial setup of a workspace's permissions requires the owners team or a team with permission to manage workspaces.

## Background

HCP Terraform manages users' permissions to workspaces with teams.

- [Workspace-level permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-permissions) can be granted to an individual team on a particular workspace. These permissions can be managed on the workspace by anyone with admin access to the workspace.
- In addition, some [organization-level permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-permissions) can be granted to a team which apply to every workspace in the organization. For example, the
  [manage all workspaces](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-workspaces) and [manage all projects](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-all-projects) permissions grant the workspace-level admin permission to every workspace in the organization. Organization-level permissions can only be managed by organization owners.

## Managing Workspace Access Permissions

When a user creates a workspace, the following teams can access that workspace with full admin permissions:
- [the owners team](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams#the-owners-team)
- teams with "Manage all workspaces" and/or “Manage all projects” [organization permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#project-permissions)
- teams with “Project Admin” project permissions

You cannot override these teams' permissions through the workspace's specific permissions.

To manage a team's access to a workspace, select "Team Access" from the workspace's "Settings" menu.

This screen displays all teams granted workspace-level permissions to the workspace. To add a team, select "Add team and permissions".

HCP Terraform displays the teams you can grant workspace access to. Select a team to continue and configure that team's permissions.

There are four [fixed permissions sets](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#fixed-permission-sets) available for basic usage: Read, Plan, Write, and Admin.

To enable finer-grained selection of non-admin permissions, select "Customize permissions for this team". On this screen, you can select specific permissions to grant the team for the workspace. 

For more information on permissions, see [the documentation on Workspace Permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-permissions).
