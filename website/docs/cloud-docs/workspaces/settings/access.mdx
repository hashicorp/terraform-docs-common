# Managing Access to Workspaces

-> **Note:** Team management is a paid feature, available as part of the **Team** upgrade package. [Learn more about Terraform Cloud pricing here](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

Terraform Cloud workspaces can only be accessed by users with the correct permissions. You can manage permissions for a workspace on a per-team basis.

Teams with [admin access](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions) on a workspace can manage permissions for other teams on that workspace. Since newly created workspaces don't have any team permissions configured, the initial setup of a workspace's permissions requires the owners team or a team with permission to manage workspaces.

## Background

Terraform Cloud manages users' permissions to workspaces with teams.

- [Workspace-level permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-permissions) can be granted to an individual team on a particular workspace. These permissions can be managed on the workspace by anyone with admin access to the workspace.
- In addition, some [organization-level permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-permissions) can be granted to a team which apply to every workspace in the organization. For example, the
  [manage workspaces only](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-workspaces-only) and [manage all projects & workspaces](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#manage-workspaces-only) permissions grant the workspace-level admin permission to every workspace in the organization. Organization-level permissions can only be managed by organization owners.

## Managing Workspace Access Permissions

When a user creates a workspace, only [the owners team](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams#the-owners-team), teams with the "Manage Workspaces" or the “Manage Projects & Workspaces” [organization permission](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#project-permissions), and teams with the “Project Admin” project permission can access a workspace with full admin permissions. You cannot override these teams' permissions through the workspace's specific permissions. 

To manage a team's access to a workspace, select "Team Access" from the workspace's "Settings" menu.

This screen displays all teams granted workspace-level permissions to the workspace. To add a team, select "Add team and permissions".

Terraform Cloud displays the teams you can grant workspace access to. Select a team to continue and configure that team's permissions.

There are four [fixed permissions sets](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#fixed-permission-sets) available for basic usage: Read, Plan, Write, and Admin.

To enable finer-grained selection of non-admin permissions, select "Customize permissions for this team". On this screen, you can select specific permissions to grant the team for the workspace. 

For more information on permissions, see [the documentation on Workspace Permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-permissions).
