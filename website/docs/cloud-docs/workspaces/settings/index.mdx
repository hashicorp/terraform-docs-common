# Workspace Settings

You can change a workspace’s settings after creation. Workspace settings are separated into several pages.

- [General](#general): Settings that determine how the workspace functions, including its name, description, associated project, Terraform version, and execution mode.
- [Health](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/health): Settings that let you configure health assessments, including drift detection and continuous validation.
- [Locking](#locking): Locking a workspace temporarily prevents new plans and applies.
- [Notifications](#notifications): Settings that let you configure run notifications.
- [Policies](#policies): Settings that let you toggle between Sentinel policy evaluation experiences.
- [Run Triggers](#run-triggers): Settings that let you configure run triggers. Run triggers allow runs to queue automatically in your workspace when runs in other workspaces are successful.
- [SSH Key](#ssh-key): Set a private SSH key for downloading Terraform modules from Git-based module sources.
- [Team Access](#team-access): Settings that let you manage which teams can view the workspace and use it to provision infrastructure.
- [Version Control](#version-control): Manage the workspace’s VCS integration.
- [Destruction and Deletion](#destruction-and-deletion): Remove a workspace and the infrastructure it manages.

Changing settings requires admin access to the relevant workspace. ([More about permissions.](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

-> **API:** See the [Update a Workspace endpoint](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#update-a-workspace) (`PATCH /organizations/:organization_name/workspaces/:name`).

## General

General settings let you change a workspace's name, description, the project it belongs to, and details about how Terraform runs operate. After changing these settings, click **Save settings** at the bottom of the page.

### ID

Every workspace has a unique ID that you cannot change. You may need to reference the workspace's ID when using the [Terraform Cloud API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs).

Click the icon beside the ID to copy it to your clipboard.

### Name

The display name of the workspace.

!> **Warning:** Some API calls refer to a workspace by its name, so changing the name may break existing integrations.

### Project

The [project](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/organize-workspaces-with-projects) that this workspace belongs to. Changing the workspace’s project can change the read and write permissions for the workspace and which users can access it. Refer to [Project Permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#project-permissions) for more detail on workspace access.

### Description (Optional)

Enter a brief description of the workspace's purpose or types of infrastructure.

### Execution Mode

Whether to use Terraform Cloud as the Terraform execution platform for this workspace.

By default, Terraform Cloud uses an organization's [default execution mode](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#organization-settings) to choose the execution platform for a workspace. Alternatively, you can instead choose a custom execution mode for a workspace.

Specifying the "Remote" execution mode instructs Terraform Cloud to perform Terraform runs on its own disposable virtual machines. This provides a consistent and reliable run environment and enables advanced features like Sentinel policy enforcement, cost estimation, notifications, version control integration, and more.

To disable remote execution for a workspace, change its execution mode to "Local". This mode lets you perform Terraform runs locally with the [CLI-driven run workflow](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/cli). The workspace will store state and variables, which Terraform can access with the [CLI integration](/terraform/cli/cloud).

If you instead need to allow Terraform Cloud to communicate with isolated, private, or on-premises infrastructure, consider using [Terraform Cloud Agents](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents). By deploying a lightweight agent, you can establish a simple connection between your environment and Terraform Cloud.

Changing your workspace's execution mode after a run has already been planned will cause the run to error when it is applied.

To minimize the number of runs that error when changing your workspace's execution mode, you should:

1. Disable [auto-apply](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#auto-apply-and-manual-apply) if you have it enabled.
1. Complete any runs that are no longer in the [pending stage](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/states#the-pending-stage).
1. [Lock](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#locking) your workspace to prevent any new runs.
1. Change the execution mode.
1. Enable [auto-apply](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#auto-apply-and-manual-apply), if you had it enabled before changing your execution mode.
1. [Unlock](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#locking) your workspace.

### Apply Method

Whether or not Terraform Cloud should automatically apply a successful Terraform plan. If you choose manual apply, an operator must confirm a successful plan and choose to apply it.

Auto-apply has the following exception:

- Plans queued by users without permission to apply runs for the workspace must be approved by a user who does have permission. ([More about permissions.](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))
- Plans queued due to [run triggers](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-triggers) from another workspace must always be manually applied.

### Terraform Version

The Terraform version to use for all operations in the workspace. The default value is whichever release was current when the workspace was created.

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Upgrade Terraform Version in Terraform Cloud](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/cloud-versions) tutorial.

-> **API:** You can specify a Terraform version when [creating a workspace](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#create-a-workspace) via the API. The API also supports setting a valid [version constraint](/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints) as the Terraform version.

### Terraform Working Directory

The directory where Terraform will execute, specified as a relative path from the root of the configuration directory. Defaults to the root of the configuration directory.

Terraform Cloud will change to this directory before starting a Terraform run, and will report an error if the directory does not exist.

Setting a working directory creates a default filter for automatic run triggering, and sometimes causes CLI-driven runs to upload additional configuration content.

#### Default Run Trigger Filtering

In VCS-backed workspaces that specify a working directory, Terraform Cloud assumes that only changes within that working directory should trigger a run. You can override this behavior with the [Automatic Run Triggering](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/vcs#automatic-run-triggering) settings.

#### Parent Directory Uploads

If a working directory is configured, Terraform Cloud always expects the complete shared configuration directory to be available, since the configuration might use local modules from outside its working directory.

In [runs triggered by VCS commits](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/ui), this is automatic. In [CLI-driven runs](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/cli), Terraform's CLI sometimes uploads additional content:

- When the local working directory _does not match_ the name of the configured working directory, Terraform assumes it is the root of the configuration directory, and uploads only the local working directory.
- When the local working directory _matches_ the name of the configured working directory, Terraform uploads one or more parents of the local working directory, according to the depth of the configured working directory. (For example, a working directory of `production` is only one level deep, so Terraform would upload the immediate parent directory. `consul/production` is two levels deep, so Terraform would upload the parent and grandparent directories.)

If you use the working directory setting, always run Terraform from a complete copy of the configuration directory. Moving one subdirectory to a new location can result in unexpected content uploads.

### Remote State Sharing

Which other workspaces within the organization can access the state of the workspace during [runs managed by Terraform Cloud](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations#remote-operations). The [`terraform_remote_state` data source](/terraform/language/state/remote-state-data) relies on state sharing to access workspace outputs.

- If "Share state globally" is enabled, all other workspaces within the organization can access this workspace's state during runs.
- If global sharing is turned off, you can specify a list of workspaces within the organization that can access this workspace's state; no other workspaces will be allowed.

  The workspace selector is searchable; if you don't initially see a workspace you're looking for, type part of its name.

By default, new workspaces in Terraform Cloud do not allow other workspaces to access their state. We recommend that you follow the principle of least privilege and only enable state access between workspaces that specifically need information from each other. To configure remote state sharing, a user must have read access for the destination workspace. If a user does not have access to the destination workspace due to scoped project or workspace permissions, they will not have complete visibility into the list of other workspace that can access its state.

-> **Note:** The default access permissions for new workspaces in Terraform Cloud changed in April 2021. Workspaces created before this change defaulted to allowing global access within their organization. These workspaces can be changed to more restrictive access at any time. Terraform Enterprise administrators can choose whether new workspaces on their instances default to global access or selective access.

### User Interface

Select the user experience for displaying plan and apply details.

The default experience is _Structured Run Output_, which displays your plan and apply results in a human-readable format. This includes nodes that you can expand to view details about each resource and any configured output.

The Console UI experience is the traditional Terraform experience, where live text logging is streamed in real time to the UI. This experience most closely emulates the CLI output.

~> **Note:** Your workspace must be configured to use a Terraform version of 1.0.5 or higher for the Structured Run Output experience to be fully supported. Workspaces running versions from 0.15.2 may see partial functionality. Workspaces running versions below 0.15.2 will default to the "Console UI" experience regardless of the User Interface setting.

## Locking

~> **Important:** Unlike other settings, locks can also be managed by users with permission to lock and unlock the workspace. ([More about permissions.](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

If you need to prevent Terraform runs for any reason, you can lock a workspace. This prevents all applies (and many kinds of plans) from proceeding, and affects runs created via UI, CLI, API, and automated systems. To enable runs again, a user must unlock the workspace.

Two kinds of run operations can ignore workspace locking because they cannot affect resources or state and do not attempt to lock the workspace themselves:

- Plan-only runs.
- The planning stages of [saved plan runs](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/modes-and-options.mdx#saved-plans). You can only _apply_ a saved plan if the workspace is unlocked, and applying that plan locks the workspace as usual. Terraform Enterprise does not yet support this workflow.

Locking a workspace also restricts state uploads. In order to upload state, the workspace must be locked by the user who is uploading state.

Users with permission to lock and unlock a workspace can't unlock a workspace which was locked by another user. Users with admin access to a workspace can force unlock a workspace even if another user has locked it.

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

Locks are managed with a single "Lock/Unlock/Force unlock `<WORKSPACE NAME>`" button. Terraform Cloud asks for confirmation when unlocking.

You can also manage the workspace's lock from the **Actions** menu.

## Notifications

The "Notifications" page allows Terraform Cloud to send webhooks to external services whenever specific run events occur in a workspace.

See [Run Notifications](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/notifications) for detailed information about configuring notifications.

## Policies

Terraform Cloud offers two experiences for Sentinel policy evaluations. On the "Policies" page, you can adjust your **Sentinel Experience** settings to your preferred experience. By default, Terraform Cloud enables the newest policy evaluation experience.

To toggle between the two Sentinel policy evaluation experiences, click the **Enable the new Sentinel policy experience** toggle under the **Sentinel Experience** heading. Terraform Cloud persists your changes automatically. If Terraform Cloud is performing a run on a different page, you must refresh that page to see changes to your policy evaluation experience.

## Run Triggers

The "Run Triggers" page configures connections between a workspace and one or more source workspaces. These connections, called "run triggers", allow runs to queue automatically in a workspace on successful apply of runs in any of the source workspaces.

See [Run Triggers](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-triggers) for detailed information about configuring run triggers.

## SSH Key

If a workspace's configuration uses [Git-based module sources](/terraform/language/modules/sources) to reference Terraform modules in private Git repositories, Terraform needs an SSH key to clone those repositories. The "SSH Key" page lets you choose which key it should use.

See [Using SSH Keys for Cloning Modules](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/ssh-keys) for detailed information about this page.

## Team Access

The "Team Access" page configures which teams can perform which actions on a workspace.

See [Managing Access to Workspaces](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/access) for detailed information.

## Version Control

The "Version Control" page configures an optional VCS repository that contains the workspace's Terraform configuration. Version control integration is only relevant for workspaces with [remote execution](#execution-mode) enabled.

See [VCS Connections](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/vcs) for detailed information about this page.

## Destruction and Deletion

The **Destruction and Deletion** page allows [admin users](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions) to delete a workspace's managed infrastructure or delete the workspace itself.

For details, refer to [Destruction and Deletion](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/deletion) for detailed information about this page.
