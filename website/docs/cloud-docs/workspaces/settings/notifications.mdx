# Notifications

Terraform Cloud can use webhooks to notify external systems about [drift detection](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/drift-detection) and run progress. Each workspace has its own notification settings and can notify up to 20 destinations.

Configuring notifications requires admin access to the workspace. Refer to [Permissions](/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions) for details.

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

-> **API:** Refer to [Notification Configuration APIs](/cloud-docs/api-docs/notification-configurations).

## Viewing and Managing Notification Settings

To add, edit, or delete notifications for a workspace, go to the workspace and click **Settings > Notifications**. The **Notifications** page appears, showing existing notification configurations.

## Creating a Notification Configuration

A notification configuration specifies a destination URL, a payload type, and the events that should generate a notification. To create a notification configuration:

1. Click **Settings > Notifications**. The **Notifications** page appears.
1. Click **Create a Notification**. The **Create a Notification** form appears.
1. Configure the notifications:

   - **Destination:** Terraform Cloud can deliver either a generic payload or a payload formatted specifically for Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Email. Refer to [Notification Payloads](#notification-payloads) for details.

   - **Name:** A display name for this notification configuration.

   - **Webhook URL** This is only available for generic, Slack, and Microsoft Teams webhooks. The webhook URL is the destination for the webhook payload. This URL must accept HTTP or HTTPS `POST` requests and should be able to use the chosen payload type. For details, refer to the [Slack documentation - Create an Incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#create_a_webhook) and the [Microsoft Teams documentation - Create an Incoming Webhook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook).
   - **Token** (Optional) This is only available for generic webhooks. A token is an arbitrary secret string that Terraform Cloud will use to sign its notification webhooks. Refer to [Notification Authenticity][inpage-hmac] for details. The token is encrypted for storage, so you cannot view it after saving the notification configuration.

   - **Email Recipients** This is only available for emails. Select users that should receive notifications.

   - **Workspace Events:** Terraform Cloud can send notifications for all events or only for specific events. The following events are available:
       - **Drift**: Terraform Cloud detected configuration drift. This notification is only available if [drift detection](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/drift-detection) is enabled for the workspace.
       - **Drift Check Fail**: A drift detection assessment failed. This notification is only available if [drift detection](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/drift-detection) is enabled for the workspace.
   - **Run Events:** Terraform Cloud can send notifications for all events or only for specific events. The following events are available:
       - **Created**: A run is created and enters the [Pending stage](/cloud-docs/run/states#1-the-pending-stage).
       - **Planning**: A run acquires the lock and starts to execute.
       - **Needs Attention**: A plan has changes and Terraform requires user input to continue. This may include approving the plan or a [policy override](/cloud-docs/run/states#7-the-policy-check-stage).
       - **Applying**: A run enters the [Apply stage](/cloud-docs/run/states#8-the-apply-stage), where Terraform makes the infrastructure changes described in the plan.
       - **Completed**: A run has completed successfully.
       - **Errored**: A run has terminated early due to error or cancellation.

1. Click **Create a notification**.

## Enabling and Verifying a Configuration

To enable or disable a configuration, toggle the **Enabled/Disabled** switch on its detail page. Terraform Cloud will attempt to verify the configuration for generic and slack webhooks by sending a test message, and will enable the notification configuration if the test succeeds.

For a verification to be successful, the destination must respond with a `2xx` HTTP code. If verification fails, Terraform Cloud displays the error message and the configuration will remain disabled.

For both successful and unsuccessful verifications, click the **Last Response** box to view more information about the verification results. You can also send additional test messages with the **Send a Test** link.

## Notification Payloads

### Slack

Notifications to Slack will contain the following information:

- The run's workspace (as a link)
- The Terraform Cloud username and avatar of the person that created the run
- The run ID (as a link)
- The reason the run was queued (usually a commit message or a custom message)
- The time the run was created
- The event that triggered the notification and the time that event occurred

### Microsoft Teams

Notifications to Microsoft Teams contain the following information:

- The run's workspace (as a link)
- The Terraform Cloud username and avatar of the person that created the run
- The run ID
- A link to view the run
- The reason the run was queued (usually a commit message or a custom message)
- The time the run was created
- The event that triggered the notification and the time that event occurred

-> **Note:** Microsoft Teams notifications are available in Terraform Enterprise v202206-1 and later.

### Email

Email notifications will contain the following information:

- The run's workspace (as a link)
- The run ID (as a link)
- The event that triggered the notification, and if the run needs to be acted upon or not

### Generic

A generic notification will contain information about a run and its state at the time the triggering event occurred. The complete generic notification payload is described in the [API documentation][generic-payload].

[generic-payload]: /cloud-docs/api-docs/notification-configurations#notification-payload

Some of the values in the payload can be used to retrieve additional information through the API, such as:

- The [run ID](/cloud-docs/api-docs/run#get-run-details)
- The [workspace ID](/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#list-workspaces)
- The [organization name](/cloud-docs/api-docs/organizations#show-an-organization)

## Notification Authenticity

[inpage-hmac]: #notification-authenticity

Slack notifications use Slack's own protocols for verifying Terraform Cloud's webhook requests.

Generic notifications can include a signature for verifying the request. For notification configurations that include a secret token, Terraform Cloud's webhook requests will include an `X-TFE-Notification-Signature` header, which contains an HMAC signature computed from the token using the SHA-512 digest algorithm. The receiving service is responsible for validating the signature. More information, as well as an example of how to validate the signature, can be found in the [API documentation](/cloud-docs/api-docs/notification-configurations#notification-authenticity).
