# Destruction and Deletion

Terraform Cloud workspaces have two primary delete actions:

- [Destroying infrastructure](#destroy-infrastructure) deletes resources managed by the Terraform Cloud workspace by triggering a destroy run.
- [Deleting a workspace](#delete-workspaces) deletes the workspace itself without triggering a destroy run.

In general, you should perform both actions in the above order when destroying a workspace to ensure resource cleanup for all of a workspace's managed infrastructure.

## Destroy Infrastructure

Destroy plans delete the infrastructure managed by a workspace. We recommend destroying the infrastructure managed by a workspace _before_ deleting the workspace itself. Otherwise, the unmanaged infrastructure resources will continue to exist but will become unmanaged, and you must go into your infrastructure providers to delete the resources manually.

Before queuing a destroy plan, enable the **Allow destroy plans** toggle setting on this page.

### Automatically Destroy

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->
@include 'tfc-package-callouts/ephemeral-workspaces.mdx'
<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

There are two main ways of configuring auto destroy for a workspace. The first auto destroy method allows you to schedule a run to destroy all resources in a workspace at a specific
date and time. The second allows you to configure the destruction of a workspace's infrastructure after a period of inactivity. This ephemeral workspace entitlement reduces your infrastructure
spend by helping you automatically destroy resources that you only need
temporarily, such as development environments.

After Terraform Cloud performs an auto destroy run, it unsets the `auto-destroy` flag on the workspace. If you continue using the workspace, you can schedule another future auto destroy run to remove any new resources. 

!> **Note:** Automatic destroy plans _do not_ prompt you for apply approval in the Terraform Cloud user interface. We recommend only using this setting for development environments.

You can schedule an auto destroy run using the Terraform Cloud web UI, or the [workspace API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces).

You can schedule [notifications](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/notifications) to alert you 12 and 24 hours before an auto destroy run, and to report auto destroy run results.

#### Destroy at Specific Time

To schedule an auto destroy run at a specific time in Terraform Cloud:
1. Navigate to the workspace's **Settings** > **Destruction and Deletion** page.
1. Under **Automatically destroy**, click **Set up auto destroy**.
1. Enter the desired date and time. Terraform Cloud defaults to your local time zone for scheduling and displays how long until the scheduled operation.
1. Click **Confirm auto destroy**.

To cancel a scheduled auto destroy run in Terraform Cloud:
1. Navigate to the workspace's **Settings** > **Destruction and Deletion** page.
1. Under **Automatically destroy**, click **Edit** next to your scheduled run's details.
1. Click **Remove**.

#### Destroy if Inactive

You can configure Terraform Cloud to automatically destroy a workspace's infrastructure after a period of inactivity. Any runs that update Terraform state will push back the scheduled auto destroy time by the configured activity duration designated by the user.

To schedule an auto destroy run after a period of inactivity in Terraform Cloud:
1. Navigate to the workspace's **Settings** > **Destruction and Deletion** page.
1. Under **Automatically destroy**, click **Set up auto destroy**.
1. Click the **Destroy if inactive** toggle.
1. Enter the desired activity duration.
1. Click **Confirm auto destroy**.

When configured for the first time, the auto destroy setting will display a date and time on which an auto destroy run will next be queued. If nothing else changes, Terraform Cloud will trigger the auto destroy run and delete the workspace's infrastructure.
This auto destroy date will be updated with subsequent runs, being pushed out by the length of time configured in the duration setting.
After a manual or automatic destroy run is completed, Terraform Cloud will wait until the next apply to trigger a new auto destroy run.

## Delete Workspace

Terraform does not automatically destroy managed infrastructure when you delete a workspace.

After you delete the workspace and its state file, Terraform can _no longer track or manage_ that infrastructure. You must manually delete or [import](/terraform/cli/commands/import) any remaining resources into another Terraform workspace.

By default, [workspace administrators](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-admins) can only delete unlocked workspaces that are not managing any infrastructure. Organization owners can force delete a workspace to override these protections. Organization owners can also configure the [organization's settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#general) to let workspace administrators force delete their own workspaces.
