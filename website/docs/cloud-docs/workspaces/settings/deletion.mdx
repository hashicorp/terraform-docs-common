# Destroy infrastructure resources and delete workspaces

HCP Terraform workspaces have two primary delete actions:

- [Destroying infrastructure](#destroy-infrastructure) deletes resources managed by the HCP Terraform workspace by triggering a destroy run.
- [Deleting a workspace](#delete-workspaces) deletes the workspace itself without triggering a destroy run.

In general, you should perform both actions in the above order when destroying a workspace to ensure resource cleanup for all of a workspace's managed infrastructure.

## Destroy Infrastructure

Destroy plans delete the infrastructure managed by a workspace. We recommend destroying the infrastructure managed by a workspace _before_ deleting the workspace itself. Otherwise, the unmanaged infrastructure resources will continue to exist but will become unmanaged, and you must go into your infrastructure providers to delete the resources manually.

Before queuing a destroy plan, enable the **Allow destroy plans** toggle setting on this page.

### Automatically Destroy

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->
@include 'tfc-package-callouts/ephemeral-workspaces.mdx'
<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

Configuring automatic infrastructure destruction for a workspace requires [admin permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-admins) for that workspace.

There are two main ways to automatically destroy a workspace's resources:
* Schedule a run to destroy all resources in a workspace at a specific date and time.
* Configure HCP Terraform to destroy a workspace's infrastructure after a period of workspace inactivity.

Workspaces can inherit auto-destroy settings from their project. Refer to [managing projects](/terraform/cloud-docs/projects/manage#automatically-destroy-inactive-workspaces) for more information. You can configure an individual workspace's auto-destroy settings to override the project's configuration.

You can reduce your spending on infrastructure by automatically destroying temporary resources like development environments.

After HCP Terraform performs an auto-destroy run, it unsets the `auto-destroy-at` field on the workspace. If you continue using the workspace, you can schedule another future auto-destroy run to remove any new resources. 

!> **Note:** Automatic destroy plans _do not_ prompt you for apply approval in the HCP Terraform user interface. We recommend only using this setting for development environments.

You can schedule an auto-destroy run using the HCP Terraform web user interface, or the [workspace API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces).

You can also schedule [notifications](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/notifications) to alert you 12 and 24 hours before an auto-destroy run, and to report auto-destroy run results.

#### Destroy at a specific day and time

To schedule an auto-destroy run at a specific time in HCP Terraform:
1. Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) or Terraform Enterprise and navigate to the workspace you want to destroy.
1. Click **Settings**, and then select **Destruction and Deletion**.
1. Under **Automatically destroy**, click **Set up auto-destroy**.
1. Enter the desired date and time. HCP Terraform defaults to your local time zone for scheduling and displays how long until the scheduled operation.
1. Click **Confirm auto-destroy**.

To cancel a scheduled auto-destroy run in HCP Terraform:
1. Navigate to the workspace's **Settings** > **Destruction and Deletion** page.
1. Under **Automatically destroy**, click **Edit** next to your scheduled run's details.
1. Click **Remove**.

#### Destroy if a workspace is inactive

You can configure HCP Terraform to automatically destroy a workspace's infrastructure after a period of inactivity.
A workspace is _inactive_ if the workspace's state has not changed within your designated time period.

!> **Caution:** As opposed to configuring an auto-destroy run for a specific date and time, this setting _persists_ after queueing auto-destroy runs.

If you configure a workspace to auto-destroy its infrastructure when inactive, any run that updates Terraform state further delays the scheduled auto-destroy time by the length of your designated timeframe.

To schedule an auto-destroy run after a period of workspace inactivity:
1. Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) or Terraform Enterprise and navigate to the workspace you want to destroy.
1. Click **Settings**, then **Destruction and Deletion**.
1. Under **Automatically destroy**, click **Set up auto-destroy**.
1. Click the **Destroy if inactive** toggle.
1. Select or customize a desired timeframe of inactivity.
1. Click **Confirm auto-destroy**.

When configured for the first time, the auto-destroy duration setting displays the scheduled date and time that HCP Terraform will perform the auto-destroy run.
Subsequent auto-destroy runs and Terraform runs that update state both update the next scheduled auto-destroy date.

After HCP Terraform completes a manual or automatic destroy run, it waits until further state updates to schedule a new auto-destroy run.

To remove your workspace's auto-destroy based on inactivity:
1. Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) or Terraform Enterprise and navigate to the workspace you no longer want to auto-destroy.
1. Click **Settings**, then **Destruction and Deletion**.
1. Under **Auto-destroy settings**, click **Edit** to change the auto-destroy settings.
1. Click **Remove**.

When you move a workspace to a different project, it inherits the auto-destroy settings from the new project. If you configured the workspace to override the previous project's auto-destroy settings, it retains the override configuration in the new project.


## Delete Workspace

Terraform does not automatically destroy managed infrastructure when you delete a workspace.

After you delete the workspace and its state file, Terraform can _no longer track or manage_ that infrastructure. You must manually delete or [import](/terraform/cli/commands/import) any remaining resources into another Terraform workspace.

By default, [workspace administrators](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-admins) can only delete unlocked workspaces that are not managing any infrastructure. Organization owners can force delete a workspace to override these protections. Organization owners can also configure the [organization's settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#general) to let workspace administrators force delete their own workspaces.

## Data Retention Policies

<EnterpriseAlert>
Data retention policies are exclusive to Terraform Enterprise, and not available in HCP Terraform. <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise">Learn more about Terraform Enterprise</a>.
</EnterpriseAlert>

Define configurable data retention policies for workspaces to help reduce object storage consumption. You can define a policy that allows Terraform to _soft delete_ the backing data associated with configuration versions and state versions. Soft deleting refers to marking a data object for garbage collection so that Terraform can automatically delete the object after a set number of days.

Once an object is soft deleted, any attempts to read the object will fail. Until the garbage collection grace period elapses, you can still restore an object using the APIs described in the [configuration version documentation](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/configuration-versions) and [state version documentation](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/state-versions). After the garbage collection grace period elapses, Terraform permanently deletes the archivist storage.

The [organization policy](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/organizations#destruction-and-deletion) is the default policy applied to workspaces, but members of individual workspaces can override the policy for their workspaces.

The workspace policy always overrides the organization policy. A workspace admin can set or override the following data retention policies:

- **Organization default policy**
- **Do not auto-delete**
- **Auto-delete data**

Setting the data retention policy to **Organization default policy** disables the other data retention policy settings.
