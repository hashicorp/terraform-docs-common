# Destruction and Deletion

Terraform Cloud workspaces have two primary delete actions:

- [Destroying infrastructure](#destroy-infrastructure) deletes resources managed by the Terraform Cloud workspace by triggering a destroy run.
- [Deleting a workspace](#delete-workspaces) deletes the workspace itself without triggering a destroy run.

In general, you should perform both actions in the above order when destroying a workspace to ensure resource cleanup for all of a workspace's managed infrastructure.

## Destroy Infrastructure

Destroy plans delete the infrastructure managed by a workspace. We recommend destroying the infrastructure managed by a workspace _before_ deleting the workspace itself. Otherwise, the unmanaged infrastructure resources will continue to exist but will become unmanaged, and you must go into your infrastructure providers to delete the resources manually.

Before queuing a destroy plan, you must enable the **Allow destroy plans** toggle setting on this page.

### Automatically Destroy

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->
@include 'tfc-package-callouts/ephemeral-workspaces.mdx'
<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

Automated destroy runs are available as part of the ephemeral workspaces feature.

Some use cases may benefit from allowing Terraform Cloud to automatically schedule infrastructure deletion at some point in the future. For example, you may want to automatically destroy a workspace's resources used solely in a development environment after a certain period of time for cost savings purposes.

You can automatically schedule Terraform Cloud to run a destroy at a specific future date and time.

When Terraform Cloud performs the destroy run this setting will be automatically unset. You can re-enable it to schedule another future destroy run.

!> **Note:** Unlike other runs, automatic destroy plans _do not_ prompt you for apply approval in the Terraform Cloud user interface. We recommend only using this setting for development environments.

## Delete Workspace

Terraform does not automatically destroy managed infrastructure when you delete a workspace.

After you delete the workspace and its state file, Terraform can _no longer track or manage_ that infrastructure. You must manually delete or [import](/terraform/cli/commands/import) any remaining resources into another Terraform workspace.

By default, [workspace administrators](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-admins) can only delete unlocked workspaces that are not managing any infrastructure. Organization owners can force delete a workspace to override these protections. Organization owners can also configure the [organization's settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#general) to let workspace administrators force delete their own workspaces.
