# Destruction and Deletion

Terraform Cloud workspaces have two primary delete actions:

- [Destroying infrastructure](#destroy-infrastructure) deletes resources managed by the Terraform Cloud workspace by triggering a destroy run.
- [Deleting a workspace](#delete-workspaces) deletes the workspace itself without triggering a destroy run.

In general, you should perform both actions in the above order when destroying a workspace to ensure resource cleanup for all of a workspace's managed infrastructure.

## Destroy Infrastructure

Destroy plans delete the infrastructure managed by a workspace. We recommend destroying the infrastructure managed by a workspace _before_ deleting the workspace itself. Otherwise, the unmanaged infrastructure resources will continue to exist but will become unmanaged, and you must go into your infrastructure providers to delete the resources manually.

Before queuing a destroy plan, enable the **Allow destroy plans** toggle setting on this page.

### Automatically Destroy

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->
@include 'tfc-package-callouts/ephemeral-workspaces.mdx'
<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

Configuring automatic infrastructure destruction requires admin permissions on at least the workspace.

There are two main ways to automatically destroy a workspace's resources:
* Schedule a run to destroy all resources in a workspace at a specific date and time.
* Configure Terraform Cloud to destroy a workspace's infrastructure after a period of workspace inactivity.

You can reduce your spending on infrastructure by automatically destroying temporary resources like development environments.

After Terraform Cloud performs an auto destroy run, it unsets the `auto-destroy-at` field on the workspace. If you continue using the workspace, you can schedule another future auto destroy run to remove any new resources. 

!> **Note:** Automatic destroy plans _do not_ prompt you for apply approval in the Terraform Cloud user interface. We recommend only using this setting for development environments.

You can schedule an auto-destroy run using the Terraform Cloud web user interface, or the [workspace API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces).

You can schedule [notifications](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/notifications) to alert you 12 and 24 hours before an auto destroy run, and to report auto destroy run results.

#### Destroy at a specific day and time

To schedule an auto destroy run at a specific time in Terraform Cloud:
1. Navigate to the workspace's **Settings** > **Destruction and Deletion** page.
1. Under **Automatically destroy**, click **Set up auto destroy**.
1. Enter the desired date and time. Terraform Cloud defaults to your local time zone for scheduling and displays how long until the scheduled operation.
1. Click **Confirm auto destroy**.

To cancel a scheduled auto destroy run in Terraform Cloud:
1. Navigate to the workspace's **Settings** > **Destruction and Deletion** page.
1. Under **Automatically destroy**, click **Edit** next to your scheduled run's details.
1. Click **Remove**.

#### Destroy if a workspace is inactive

You can configure Terraform Cloud to automatically destroy a workspace's infrastructure after a period of inactivity.
A workspace is _inactive_ if the workspace's state has not changed within your designated time period.

!> **Note:** As opposed to configuring an auto-destroy run for a specific date and time, this setting will _persist_ after queued auto-destroy runs.

If you configure a workspace to auto-destroy its infrastructure when inactive, any run that updates Terraform state further delays the scheduled auto-destroy time by the length of your designated time period.

To schedule an auto-destroy run after a period of workspace inactivity:
1. Navigate to the workspace's **Settings** > **Destruction and Deletion** page.
1. Under **Automatically destroy**, click **Set up auto destroy**.
1. Click the **Destroy if inactive** toggle.
1. Enter the desired activity duration.
1. Click **Confirm auto destroy**.

When configured for the first time, the auto destroy duration setting displays the scheduled date and time that Terraform Cloud will perform the auto-destroy run.
Subsequent auto-destroy runs and Terraform runs that update state both update the next scheduled auto-destroy date.

After Terraform Cloud completes a manual or automatic destroy run, it waits until further state updates to schedule a new auto-destroy run.

To remove an auto destroy duration:
1. Navigate to the workspace's **Settings** > **Destruction and Deletion** page.
1. Under **Auto destroy settings**, click **Edit** to change the auto destroy settings.
1. Click **Remove**.

## Delete Workspace

Terraform does not automatically destroy managed infrastructure when you delete a workspace.

After you delete the workspace and its state file, Terraform can _no longer track or manage_ that infrastructure. You must manually delete or [import](/terraform/cli/commands/import) any remaining resources into another Terraform workspace.

By default, [workspace administrators](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#workspace-admins) can only delete unlocked workspaces that are not managing any infrastructure. Organization owners can force delete a workspace to override these protections. Organization owners can also configure the [organization's settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#general) to let workspace administrators force delete their own workspaces.
