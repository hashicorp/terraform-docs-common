# Reserved tag keys API reference

Use the `/reserved-tag-keys` API endpoints to define and manage tag keys that
have special meaning for your organization. Reserving tag keys enable project
and workspace managers to follow a consistent tagging strategy across the
organization. You can also use them to provide project managers with a means of
disabling overrides for inherited tags.

The following table describes the available endpoints:

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/organizations/:organization_name/reserved-tag-keys` | [List reserved tag keys](#list-reserved-tag-keys) for the specified organization. |
| `POST` | `/organizations/:organization_name/reserved-tag-keys` | [Add a reserved tag key](#add-a-reserved-tag-key) to the specified organization. |
| `PATCH` | `/reserved-tags/:reserved_tag_key_id` |  [Update a reserved tag key](#add-a-reserved-tag-value) with the specified ID. |
| `DELETE` | `/reserved-tags/:reserved_tag_key_id` | [Delete a reserved tag key](#delete-a-reserved-tag-key) with the specified ID. |


## Path parameters

The `/reserved-tag-keys/` API endpoints require the following path parameters:

| Parameter     | Description    |
|---------------|----------------|
| `:reserved_tag_key_id` | The external ID of the reserved tag key. |
| `:organization_name` | The name of the organization containing the reserved tags. |
