# Assessment Results API

An Assessment Result is the summary record of an instance of health assessment. Terraform Cloud can perform automatic health assessments in a workspace to assess whether its real infrastructure matches the requirements defined in its Terraform configuration. Refer to [Health](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/health) for more details.

-> **Note:** Health assessments are available in the [Terraform Cloud Business tier](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing). Continuous validation is in beta and not available in Terraform Enterprise.

## Show Assessment Result

Any user with read access to a workspace can retrieve assessment results for the workspace.

`GET api/v2/assessment-results/:assessment_result_id`

| Parameter               | Description              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
