# Health assessment results API reference

An Assessment Result is the summary record of an instance of health assessment. HCP Terraform can perform automatic health assessments in a workspace to assess whether its real infrastructure matches the requirements defined in its Terraform configuration. Refer to [Health](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/health) for more details.
