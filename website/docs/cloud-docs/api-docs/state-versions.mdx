# State Versions API

## Attributes

State version API objects represent an instance of Terraform state data, but do not directly contain the stored state. Instead, they contain information about the state, its properties, and its contents, and include one or more URLs from which the state can be downloaded.

Some of the information returned in a state version API object might be **populated asynchronously** by Terraform Cloud. This includes resources, modules, providers, and the [state version outputs](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/state-version-outputs) associated with the state version. These values might not be immediately available after the state version is uploaded. The `resources-processed` property on the state version object indicates whether or not Terraform Cloud has finished any necessary asynchronous processing. If you need to use these values, be sure to wait for `resources-processed` to become `true` before assuming that the values are in fact empty.

Attribute                        | Description
---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`hosted-json-state-upload-url`   | A URL to which you can upload the state data in a [stable format](/terraform/internals/json-format) appropriate for external integrations to consume. Only available if the state was created by Terraform 1.3+.
`hosted-state-upload-url`        | A URL from which you can upload the raw state data, in the format used internally by Terraform.
`hosted-json-state-download-url` | A URL from which you can download the state data in a [stable format](/terraform/internals/json-format) appropriate for external integrations to consume. Only available if the state was created by Terraform 1.3+.
`hosted-state-download-url`      | A URL from which you can download the raw state data, in the format used internally by Terraform.
`modules`                        | Extracted information about the Terraform modules in this state data. Populated asynchronously.
`providers`                      | Extracted information about the Terraform providers used for resources in this state data. Populated asynchronously.
`resources`                      | Extracted information about the resources in this state data. Populated asynchronously.
`resources-processed`            | A Boolean flag indicating whether Terraform Cloud has finished asynchronously extracting outputs, resources, and other information about this state data.
`serial`                         | The serial number of this state instance, which increases every time Terraform creates new state in the workspace.
`state-version`                  | The version of the internal state format used for this state. Different Terraform versions read and write different format versions, but it only changes infrequently.
`terraform-version`              | The Terraform version that created this state. Populated asynchronously.
`vcs-commit-sha`                 | The SHA of the configuration commit used in the Terraform run that produced this state. Only present if the workspace is connected to a VCS repository.
`vcs-commit-url`                 | A link to the configuration commit used in the Terraform run that produced this state. Only present if the workspace is connected to a VCS repository.
`status`                         | The status of the state version. See the table below for details.

### State Version States

The state version state is found in `data.attributes.status`, and you can reference the following list of possible states.

A state version created through the API or CLI will only be listed in the UI if it is in the `finalized` state.

| State        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pending`    | The initial status of a state version after it has been created without encoding the state data within the request. Pending state versions do not contain state data and will not appear in the UI. The workspace cannot be unlocked normally until the latest state version has been finalized.                                     |
| `finalized`  | The state version has been uploaded successfully to Terraform Cloud or if the state version was created with a valid `state` attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Create a State Version

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Version Remote State with the Terraform Cloud API](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/cloud-state-api) tutorial to download a remote state file and use the Terraform API to create a new state version.

`POST /workspaces/:workspace_id/state-versions`

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `:workspace_id` | The workspace ID to create the new state version in. Obtain this from the [workspace settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings) or the [Show Workspace](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#show-workspace) endpoint. |

Creates a state version and sets it as the current state version for the given workspace. The workspace must be locked by the user creating a state version. The workspace may be locked [with the API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#lock-a-workspace) or [with the UI](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#locking). This is most useful for migrating existing state from open source Terraform into a new Terraform Cloud workspace.

Creating state versions requires permission to read and write state versions for the workspace. ([More about permissions.](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

!> **Warning:** Use caution when uploading state to workspaces that have already performed Terraform runs. Replacing state improperly can result in orphaned or duplicated infrastructure resources.

-> **Note:** For Free Tier organizations, Terraform Cloud always retains at least the last 100 states (across all workspaces) and at least the most recent state for every workspace. Additional states beyond the last 100 are retained for six months, and are then deleted.

-> **Note:** You cannot access this endpoint with [organization tokens](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#organization-api-tokens). You must access it with a [user token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#api-tokens) or [team token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#team-api-tokens).

## Upload a State Version

Creates a state version but does not set it as the current state version for the given workspace until the data is uploaded to the corresponding `hosted-state-upload-url`. The workspace must be locked by the user creating a state version. The workspace may be locked with the API or with the UI. This method is useful for large amounts of state, transmitting over a slow network.

-> **Note**: If the `state` attribute is omitted when creating a state version, the upload process must be completed to finalize the state version.

### State Versions Upload URL

Once a state version is created, use the `hosted-state-upload-url` attribute to [upload state versions](#upload-state-versions) associated with that version. The `hosted-state-upload-url` attribute is only provided in the response when creating state versions.

### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type":"state-versions",
    "attributes": {
      "serial": 1,
      "md5": "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e",

    },
    "relationships": {
      "run": {
        "data": {
          "type": "runs",
          "id": "run-bWSq4YeYpfrW4mx7"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

}
```

`PUT https://archivist.terraform.io/v1/object/<UNIQUE OBJECT ID>`

**The URL is provided in the `hosted-state-upload-url` attribute when creating a `state-versions` resource. After creation, the URL is hidden on the resource and no longer available.**

### Sample Request

**@filename is the name of state file containing the data you wish to upload.**

```shell
curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
  --request PUT \
  --data-binary @filename \
  https://archivist.terraform.io/v1/object/4c44d964-eba7-4dd5-ad29-1ece7b99e8da
```

## List State Versions for a Workspace

`GET /state-versions`

Listing state versions requires permission to read state versions for the workspace. ([More about permissions.](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

## Rollback to a Previous State Version

`PATCH /workspaces/:workspace_id/state-versions`

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `:workspace_id` | The workspace ID to create the new state version in. Obtain this from the [workspace settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings) or the [Show Workspace](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#show-workspace) endpoint. |

Creates a state version by duplicating the specified state version and sets it as the current state version for the given workspace. The workspace must be locked by the user creating a state version. The workspace may be locked [with the API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#lock-a-workspace) or [with the UI](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#locking). This is most useful for rolling back to a known-good state after an operation such as a Terraform upgrade didn't go as planned.

Creating state versions requires permission to read and write state versions for the workspace. ([More about permissions.](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

!> **Warning:** Use caution when rolling back to a previous state. Replacing state improperly can result in orphaned or duplicated infrastructure resources.

-> **Note:** You cannot access this endpoint with [organization tokens](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#organization-api-tokens). You must access it with a [user token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#api-tokens) or [team token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#team-api-tokens).

## List State Version Outputs

The output values from a state version are also available via the API. For details, see the [state version outputs documentation.](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/state-version-outputs#list-state-version-outputs)

### Available Related Resources

The GET endpoints above can optionally return related resources, if requested with [the `include` query parameter](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs#inclusion-of-related-resources). The following resource types are available:

* `created_by` - The user that created the state version. For state versions created via a run executed by Terraform Cloud, this is an internal user account.
* `run` - The run that created the state version, if applicable.
* `run.created_by` - The user that manually triggered the run, if applicable.
* `run.configuration_version` - The configuration version used in the run.
* `outputs` - The parsed outputs for this state version.
