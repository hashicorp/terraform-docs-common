# Invoices API reference

-> **Note:** The invoices API is only available in HCP Terraform.

Organizations on credit-card-billed plans may view their previous and upcoming invoices.

## List Invoices

This endpoint lists the previous invoices for an organization.

It uses a pagination scheme that's somewhat different from [our standard pagination](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs#pagination). The page size is always 10 items and is not configurable; if there are no more items, `meta.continuation` will be null. The current page is controlled by the `cursor` parameter, described below.

`GET /organizations/:organization_name/invoices`

| Parameter            | Description                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `:organization_name` | The name of the organization you'd like to view invoices for                                                          |
| `:cursor`            | **Optional.** The ID of the invoice where the page should start. If omitted, the endpoint will return the first page. |
