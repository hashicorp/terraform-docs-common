# Audit trails API reference

HCP Terraform retains 14 days of audit log information. The audit trails API exposes a stream of audit events, which describe changes to the application entities (workspaces, runs, etc.) that belong to an HCP Terraform organization. Unlike other APIs, the Audit Trails API does not use the [JSON API specification](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs#json-api-formatting).

## List an organization's audit events

`GET /organization/audit-trail`

-> **Note:** This endpoint cannot be accessed with a [user token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#api-tokens) or [team token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#team-api-tokens). You must access it with an [organization token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#organization-api-tokens) or an [audit trail token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#audit-trail-tokens).

### Query Parameters

[These are standard URL query parameters](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs#query-parameters). Remember to percent-encode `[` as `%5B` and `]` as `%5D` if your tooling doesn't automatically encode URLs.

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `since`        | **Optional.** Returns only audit trails created after this date (UTC and in [ISO8601 Format](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) - YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ) |
| `page[number]` | **Optional.** If omitted, the endpoint will return the first page.                                                                                                               |
| `page[size]`   | **Optional.** If omitted, the endpoint will return 1000 audit events per page.                                                                                                   |

### Sample Request

```shell
$ curl \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  --request GET \
  "https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organization/audit-trail?page[number]=1&since=2020-05-30T17:52:46.000Z"

The following sections list the audit log events containing both the standard response schema and a specific payload for each action.

## Data retention policy events

You can define [data retention policies](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/deletion#data-retention-policies) to help reduce object storage consumption. 

### Destroy

An HCP Terraform organization emits this event when it destroys a data retention policy(`data_retention_policy`). Alongside the [standard audit trail fields](#standard-response-fields), this event response includes the following fields:

| Key                        | Data Type | Description                                             |

| `delete_older_than_n_days` | integer   | The number of days to retain data before deletion. Must be greater than 0. |
| `organization`             | string    | The organization associated with the data retention policy. |
| `organization_id`          | string    | The ID of the organization associated with the data retention policy. |

## Project events

[Projects](/terraform/cloud-docs/projects/manage) let you organize your workspaces and scope access to workspace resources.

### Add Team

An HCP Terraform organization emits this event when someone in your organization adds a team(`add_team`) to a project. Alongside the [standard audit trail fields](#standard-response-fields), this event response includes the following fields:

| Key          | Data Type | Description                           |

| `permissions` | string   | The permissions granted to the team.  |

### Update Team Permissions

An HCP Terraform organization emits this event when someone in your organization updates the permissions(`update_team_permissions`) of a team on a project. Alongside the [standard audit trail fields](#standard-response-fields), this event response includes the following fields:

| Key          | Data Type | Description                           |
| ---          | ---       | ---                                   |
| `team`       | string    | The name or identifier of the team.    |
| `permissions` | string   | The updated permissions for the team. |

### Remove Team

An HCP Terraform organization emits this event when someone in your organization removes a team(`remove_team`) from a project. Alongside the [standard audit trail fields](#standard-response-fields), this event response includes the following fields:

| Key          | Data Type | Description                           |
| ---          | ---       | ---                                   |
| `team`       | string    | The name or identifier of the team.    |

## Policy checks

[Policy checks run Sentinel policies](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets). Policy checks have a lifecycle that includes the following events:

## Registry module events

[HCP Terraform's private registry](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry) lets you share Terraform providers and Terraform modules across your organization.

## Run task events

You can create HCP Terraform [run tasks](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) at an organization level to directly integrate third-party tools and services at certain stages in the HCP Terraform run lifecycle. You can use run tasks to validate Terraform configuration files, analyze execution plans before applying them, scan for security vulnerabilities, or perform other custom actions.
