# Audit Trails API

Terraform Cloud retains 14 days of audit log information. The audit trails API exposes a stream of audit events, which describe changes to the application entities (workspaces, runs, etc.) that belong to a Terraform Cloud organization. Unlike other APIs, the Audit Trails API does not use the [JSON API specification](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs#json-api-formatting).

## List an organization's audit events

`GET /organization/audit-trail`

-> **Note:** This endpoint cannot be accessed with a [user token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/users#api-tokens) or [team token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#team-api-tokens). You must access it with an [organization token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#organization-api-tokens).

### Query Parameters

[These are standard URL query parameters](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs#query-parameters). Remember to percent-encode `[` as `%5B` and `]` as `%5D` if your tooling doesn't automatically encode URLs.

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `since`        | **Optional.** Returns only audit trails created after this date (UTC and in [ISO8601 Format](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) - YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ) |
| `page[number]` | **Optional.** If omitted, the endpoint will return the first page.                                                                                                               |
| `page[size]`   | **Optional.** If omitted, the endpoint will return 1000 audit events per page.                                                                                                   |

### Sample Request

```shell
$ curl \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  --request GET \
  "https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organization/audit-trail?page[number]=1&since=2020-05-30T17:52:46.000Z"

The following sections list the audit log events containing both the standard response schema and a specific payload for each action.

## Data retention policy events

You can define [data retention policies](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/deletion#data-retention-policies) to help reduce object storage consumption. 

### Destroy

A Terraform Cloud organization emits this event when it destroys a data retention policy(`data_retention_policy`). Alongside the [standard audit trail fields](#standard-response-fields), this event response includes the following fields:

| Key                        | Data Type | Description                                             |

| `delete_older_than_n_days` | integer   | The number of days to retain data before deletion. Must be greater than 0. |
| `organization`             | string    | The organization associated with the data retention policy. |
| `organization_id`          | string    | The ID of the organization associated with the data retention policy. |

## Project events

[Projects](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/organize-workspaces-with-projects) let you organize your workspaces and scope access to workspace resources.

### Add Team

A Terraform Cloud organization emits this event when someone in your organization adds a team(`add_team`) to a project. Alongside the [standard audit trail fields](#standard-response-fields), this event response includes the following fields:

| Key          | Data Type | Description                           |
| ---          | ---       | ---                                   |
| `team`       | string    | The name or identifier of the team.    |
| `permissions` | string   | The permissions granted to the team.  |

### Update Team Permissions

A Terraform Cloud organization emits this event when someone in your organization updates the permissions(`update_team_permissions`) of a team on a project. Alongside the [standard audit trail fields](#standard-response-fields), this event response includes the following fields:

| Key          | Data Type | Description                           |
| ---          | ---       | ---                                   |
| `team`       | string    | The name or identifier of the team.    |
| `permissions` | string   | The updated permissions for the team. |

### Remove Team

A Terraform Cloud organization emits this event when someone in your organization removes a team(`remove_team`) from a project. Alongside the [standard audit trail fields](#standard-response-fields), this event response includes the following fields:

| Key          | Data Type | Description                           |
| ---          | ---       | ---                                   |
| `team`       | string    | The name or identifier of the team.    |

## Policy checks

[Policy checks run Sentinel policies](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets). Policy checks have a lifecycle that includes the following events:

| Key                   | Data Type       | Description                                     |

| `sentinel`            | string          | The Sentinel policy associated with the check.  |

| `actor`               | string       | The user who performed the action.              |

## Run task events

You can create Terraform Cloud [run tasks](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) at an organization level to directly integrate third-party tools and services at certain stages in the Terraform Cloud run lifecycle.
