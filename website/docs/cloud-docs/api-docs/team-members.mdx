# Team Membership API

-> **Note:** Team management is a paid feature, available as part of the **Team** upgrade package. Free organizations can also use this API, but can only manage membership of their owners team. [Learn more about Terraform Cloud pricing here](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

The Team Membership API is used to add or remove users from teams. The [Team API](/cloud-docs/api-docs/teams) is used to create or destroy teams.

## Organization Membership

-> **Note:** To add users to a team, they must first receive and accept the invitation to join the organization by email. This process ensures that you do not accidentally add the wrong person by mistyping a username. Refer to [the Organization Memberships API documentation](/cloud-docs/api-docs/organization-memberships) for more information.

## Add a User to Team (With user ID)

This method adds multiple users to a team using the user ID. Both users and teams must already exist.

| `:team_id` | The ID of the team. |

### Request Body

This POST endpoint requires a JSON object with the following properties as a request payload.

Properties without a default value are required.
