# Team membership API reference

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

-> **Note:** Team management is available in HCP Terraform **Standard**, **Plus**, and **Premium** editions. Free organizations can also use this API, but can only manage membership of their owners team. [Learn more about HCP Terraform pricing here](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

The Team Membership API is used to add or remove users from teams. The [Team API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/teams) is used to create or destroy teams.

## Organization Membership

-> **Note:** To add users to a team, they must first receive and accept the invitation to join the organization by email. This process ensures that you do not accidentally add the wrong person by mistyping a username. Refer to [the Organization Memberships API documentation](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/organization-memberships) for more information.

## Add a User to Team (With user ID)

This method adds multiple users to a team using the user ID. Both users and teams must already exist.

`POST /teams/:team_id/relationships/users`

| Parameter  | Description         |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| `:team_id` | The ID of the team. |

### Request Body

This POST endpoint requires a JSON object with the following properties as a request payload.

Properties without a default value are required.

| Key path      | Type   | Default | Description                      |
