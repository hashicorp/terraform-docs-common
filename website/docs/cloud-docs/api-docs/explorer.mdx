# Explorer API

Explorer allows you to query your Terraform Cloud data across workspaces in an organization.
You can select from a variety of available views and supply optional sort and
filter parameters to present your data in the format that best suits your needs.

Queries are scoped to the organization level. You must have owner permissions in the organization, or read access to workspaces and projects.

## Execute a query

`GET /organizations/:organization_name/explorer`

| Parameter            | Description |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `:organization_name` | The name of the organization to query. The organization must already exist and you must have permissions to read the organization's workspaces and projects. |

-> **Note:** Explorer is restricted to the owners team, teams with the "Read all
workspaces" permission, teams with the "Read all projects" permission, and the [organization API token](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#organization-api-tokens).

Explorer queries will time out after 60 seconds. If the desired query is timing
out, try a simpler query that uses less filters.

Requests to the explorer are subject to [rate
limiting](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs#rate-limiting). Explorer will return a
429 status code when rate limiting is active for the authenticated context.

Data presented by the explorer is eventually consistent. Query results typically
contain data that represents the current state of the system, but in some cases
a small delay may be necessary before querying for data that has recently been
updated.

### Query Parameters

This GET endpoint requires a query string that supports the following properties.

| Parameter      | Description |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`         | **Required.** Must be one of the following available views: `workspaces`, `tf_versions`, `providers`, or `modules`. See the [View Types](#view-types) section for more information about each. |
| `sort`         | Optionally sort the returned data by the specified field name. The field name must use snake case and exist within the supplied view type. The field name supplied can be prefixed with a hyphen (`-`) to perform a descending sort. |
| `filter`       | Optionally specify one or more filters to limit the data returned. See [Filtering](#filtering) for more information. |
| `fields`       | Optionally limit the data returned only to the specified fields. The field names supplied must use snake case and be submitted in comma-separated format. If omitted, all available fields will be returned for the requested view type. |
| `page[number]` | Optional. If omitted, the endpoint will return the first page. |
| `page[size]`   | Optional. If omitted, the endpoint will use a default page size. |

### View Types

Explorer queries each require a view, specified by the `type` query string parameter.
There are several contextual views available for querying:

| Type          | Description |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workspaces`  | Information about the workspaces in the target organization and any current runs associated with them. Each row returned represents a single workspace. See [View Type: workspaces](#view-type-workspaces) for available fields. |
| `tf_versions` | Information about the Terraform versions in use across this organization. Each row returned represents a Terraform version in use. See [View Type: tf_versions](#view-type-tf_versions) for available fields. |
| `providers`   | Information about the Terraform providers in use across the target organization. Each row returned represents a Terraform provider in use. See [View Type: providers](#view-type-providers) for available fields. |
| `modules`     | Information about the Terrraform modules in use across the target organization. Each row returned represents a Terraform module in use. See [View Type: modules](#view-type-modules) for available fields. |

The fields returned by a given query are specific to the view type used. The

### Filtering

The explorer can present filtered data from any view type using a variety of
operators.

Filter strings begin with the reserved string `filter`, and are passed as URL
query string parameters using key-value pairs. The parameter key contains the
filter's target field and operator, and the parameter value contains the filter
value to be used during the query.

Multiple filters can be used in a query by providing multiple filter query
string parameters separated with `&`. When multiple filters are used, a logical AND is used
to evaluate the results.

Each filter string must use the following format:

```
filter[<FILTER_INDEX>][<FIELD_NAME>][<FIELD_OPERATOR>][FIELD_VALUE_INDEX]=<FILTER VALUE>
```

**Filter string sub-parameters**

- **FILTER_INDEX**: The index of the filter. Each filter requires a unique
  index. The first filter should use a `0` and each additional filter should
  use an index that is the previous filter's index incremented by 1.
- **FIELD_NAME**: The name of the field to apply the filter to. The field must
  be a valid field for the view type being queried. See [View
  Types](#view-types) for a list of fields available for each type.
- **FIELD_OPERATOR**: The operator to use when filtering. Must be supported by
the field type being filtered. See [Filter Operators](#filter-operators) for the
available operators and their supported field types.
- **FIELD_VALUE_INDEX**: Must be `0`. This sub-parameter is reserved for future use.
- **FILTER_VALUE**: The filter value used by the filter during the query.

Once the desired filter strings have been added to a request URI, they should be
percent-encoded along with the rest of the query string parameters.

#### Sample Filter Strings

**View Type: `workspace`**

_Show workspaces that contain `test` in their name:_

```
filter[0][workspace_name][contains][0]=test
```

_After encoding:_
```
filter%5B0%5D%5Bworkspace_name%5D%5Bcontains%5D%5B0%5D=test
```

**View Type: `modules`**

_Show modules that contain `aws` in their name and version string equal to `1.1`_

```
filter[0][name][contains][0]=aws&filter[0][version][is][0]=1.1
```

_After encoding:_
```
filter%5B0%5D%5Bname%5D%5Bcontains%5D%5B0%5D=aws&filter%5B0%5D%5Bversion%5D%5Bis%5D%5B0%5D=1.1
```

#### Filter Operators

| Operator           | Supported Field Types         | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| `is`               | `boolean`, `number`, `string` | Filters data to rows where the field value is equivalent to the filter value. |
| `is_not`           | `number`, `string`            | Filters data to rows where the field value is different from the filter value. |
| `contains`         | `string`                      | Filters data to rows where the field value contains the filter value as a sub-string. |
| `does not contain` | `string`                      | Filters data to rows where the field value does not contain the filter value as a sub-string. |
| `is_empty`         | `boolean`, `number`, `string` | Filters data to rows where the field does not contain a value. |
| `is_not_empty`     | `boolean`, `number`, `string` | Filters data to rows where the field contains any value. |
| `gt`               | `number`                      | Filters data to rows where the field value is greater than the filter value. |
| `lt`               | `number`                      | Filters data to rows where the field value is less than the filter value. |
| `gteq`             | `number`                      | Filters data to rows where the field value is greater than or equal to the filter value. |
| `lteq`             | `number`                      | Filters data to rows where the field value is less than or equal to the filter value. |
| `is_before`        | `datetime`                    | Filters data to rows where the field value is earlier than the filter value. ISO 8601 formatted dates are recommended for filter values. If no time zone offset is provided, the filter value will be interpreted as UTC. |
| `is_after`         | `datetime`                    | Filters data to rows where the field value is earlier than the filter value. ISO 8601 formatted dates are recommended for filter values. If no time zone offset is provided, the filter value will be interpreted as UTC. |

### Pagination

This endpoint supports pagination [with standard URL query parameters](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs#query-parameters). Remember to percent-encode `[` as `%5B` and `]` as `%5D` if your tooling doesn't automatically encode URLs.

This endpoint can be used to download a full, unpaged export of the query results
in CSV format.

Explorer queries will time out after 60 seconds. If the desired query is timing
out, try a simpler query that uses less filters.

Requests to the explorer are subject to [rate
limiting](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs#rate-limiting). Explorer will return a
429 status code when rate limiting is active for the authenticated context.

Data presented by the explorer is eventually consistent. Query results typically
contain data that represents the current state of the system, but in some cases
a small delay may be necessary before querying for data that has recently been
updated.
