# Use single sign-on with SAML

The SAML SSO integration currently supports the following features of SAML 2.0:

- Service Provider (SP)-initiated SSO
- Identity Provider (IdP)-initiated SSO
- Just-in-Time Provisioning

The SAML SSO integration can be configured by providing a metadata URL or manually with the Single Sign-on URL, Entity ID, and X.509 Certificate.

## Configuration (HCP Terraform)

1. Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) and select the organization you want to enable SSO for.

1. Select **Settings** from the sidebar, then **SSO**.

1. Click **Setup SSO**.
