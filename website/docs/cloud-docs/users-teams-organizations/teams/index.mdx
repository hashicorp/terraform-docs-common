# Teams overview

Teams are groups of HCP Terraform [users][] within an [organization][organizations]. If a user belongs to at least one team in an organization, they are considered a member of that organization.

@include 'tfc-package-callouts/team-management.mdx'
<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

An organization can [grant workspace permissions to teams](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams/manage#managing-workspace-access) that allow its members to start Terraform runs, create workspace variables, read and write state, and more. Teams can only have permissions on workspaces within their organization, although individual users can belong to multiple teams in this and other organizations.

## Accessing teams with the API or TFE provider

In addition to the HCP Terraform UI, you can use the following methods to manage teams:

- [Teams API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/teams) to list, create, update, and delete teams
- [Team Members API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/team-members) to add and delete users from teams
- [Team Tokens API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/team-tokens) to generate and delete tokens and list an organization's team tokens
- [Team Access API](/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/team-access) to manage team access to one or more workspaces
- The `tfe` provider resources [`tfe_team`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/team), [`tfe_team_members`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/team_members), and `tfe_team_access`

### API tokens

Each team can have an API token not associated with a specific user. You can manage a team's API token from the **Organization settings > API Tokens > Team Token** page. You can create, regenerate, and delete team tokens on the API token page. Refer to [Team API Tokens](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#team-api-tokens) for details.

## The owners team

Every organization has an owners team, and members of the owners team are sometimes called organization owners. An organization's creator is the first member of its owner's team. You can add and remove other members in the same way as you can with other teams. In free organizations, the owner's team is limited to five members. In paid organizations, the size of the owner's team is unlimited.

You cannot delete or leave the owner's team empty. If only one member in an owner's team exists, you must add another user before removing the current member.

Refer to [organization owners](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-owners) for more details about owners team permissions.

## Manage teams 

You can manage many things about teams, including creating and deleting a team, team membership, and team access to workspaces, projects, and organizations. Refer to [Manage teams](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams/manage) to learn more.

## Team notifications

You can set up team notifications to notify team members on external systems whenever a particular action takes place. Refer to [Notifications](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams/notifications) to learn more.
