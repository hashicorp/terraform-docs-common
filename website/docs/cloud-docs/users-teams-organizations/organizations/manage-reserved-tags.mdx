# Create and manage reserved tag keys

This topic describes how to create and manage reserved tag keys in HCP Terraform. You can use reserved tag keys to help managers consistently label workspaces and projects in your organization.    

~> **This feature is in beta**: We do not recommend using beta features in production environments.

## Introduction

You can define reserved tag keys that appear as suggested labels when managers want to add tags to their projects and workspaces in the organization. Doing so helps you standardize tag keys and prevent duplicates that affect your ability to track resources. 

Refer to the following topics for information about creating and managing tags attached to projects and workspaces:

- [Create a project](/terraform/cloud-docs/projects/manage#create-a-project)
- [Create workspace tags](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/tags)

## Requirements

The **admin** permission preset must be enabled on your profile to create and manage reserved tags. Refer to [Permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-permissions) for additional information. 

## Define a reserved tag key

You can define reserved tag keys for your organization so that project and workspace managers can use consistent labels.

1. Go to your organization and choose **Settings** in the sidebar.
1. Choose **Tags** in the sidebar. 
1. Click on the **Reserved Keys** tab.
1. Click **New reserved tag key** and specify a key value when prompted. Keys are unique and can have up to 128 characters. You can use letters, numbers, spaces, and the following special characters: `.`, `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `:`, `-`, and `_`.
1. You can enable the **Disable overrides** option to prevent project and workspace managers from overriding the key. Refer to [Disable overrides for project tags](#disable-overrides-for-project-tags) for additional information.
1. Click **Save** to finish adding the key. 
   
## Delete a reserved key

1. Go to your organization and choose **Settings** in the sidebar.
1. Choose **Tags** in the sidebar. 
1. Click on the **Reserved Keys** tab.
1. Open the ellipses menu and choose **Delete <key-name\>**.
1. Click **Yes, delete reserved key** when prompted.

To re-add a key, you must manually complete the steps described in [Define a reserved tag key](#define-a-reserved-tag-key).

## Edit a reserved key

1. Go to your organization and choose **Settings** in the sidebar.
1. Choose **Tags** in the sidebar. 
1. Click on the **Reserved Keys** tab.
1. Open the ellipses menu and choose **Edit <key-name\>**.
1. Specify your changes and click **Save**.

## Disable overrides for project tags

Enable the **Disable overrides** option when creating or editing a reserved tag key to prevent project and workspace managers from overriding the tag keys. 

This option is not retroactive. When a workspace contains keys that were overridden before you enabled the **Disable overrides** option, you must first remove the tags from the workspace. You can then re-apply the keys to the workspace so that HCP Terraform can allow future updates to the workspace tag bindings.
