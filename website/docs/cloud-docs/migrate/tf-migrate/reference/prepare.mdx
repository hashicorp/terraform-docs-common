# tf-migrate prepare

The `tf-migrate prepare` command recursively scans the current directory for Terraform state files, then generates new Terraform configuration to migrate the state to HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise. 

## Usage

```
$ tf-migrate prepare [options]
```

## Description

The `tf-migrate prepare` command prompts you for the following information:

- The HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise organization to migrate your state to.
- If you would like to create a new branch named `hcp-migrate-main`.  
- If you would like it to automatically create a pull request with the updated code change when the migration is complete.

After you run the `prepare` command, Terraform migrate generates a new Terraform configuration in the `hcp-migrate-config` directory to perform the migration. This configuration creates the following resources:

- One workspace per state file  
- One project to store all workspaces  
- A new local git branch if you responded to the prompt to create a new branch with `yes`.  
- A new pull request in the remote git repository if you responded to the prompt to create a pull request with `yes`.

The `tf-migrate` CLI tool adds the generated configuration to the `.gitignore` file so that the configuration is not committed to source control.

Terraform migrate creates the following structure in HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise depending on your local configuration:

| Source | Result |
| :---- | :---- |
| Single configuration, single state | Single HCP workspace |
| Single configuration, multiple states for each Community Edition workspace | One HCP workspace per state |
| Multiple configurations, one state per configuration | One HCP workspace per configuration |
| Multiple configurations, multiple states per configuration | One HCP workspace per combination of configuration and state |

## Example

The following configuration uses the AWS S3 backend and has a single state file.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── main.tf
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `tf-migrate prepare` command generates the configuration to migrate this state to a single HCP Terraform workspace.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```
