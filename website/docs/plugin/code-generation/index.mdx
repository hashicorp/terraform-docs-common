# Code Generation
<Note>
Code Generation is currently in tech preview.
</Note>

Code generation can reduce the amount of manual effort required by developers to maintain and build [Terraform Providers](/terraform/language/providers). This section contains information about the interface, tooling, and libraries that are available to support code generation.

## Design

Provider code generation is designed to be vendor/tool agnostic and to be extensible by the Terraform ecosystem. Read more about the overall design, challenges, and related terminology in the [Design](/terraform/plugin/code-generation/design) section.

## Specification

The Provider code generation ecosystem relies on a common interface defined as an intermediate representation (IR) in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/). See the [Specification](/terraform/plugin/code-generation/specification) section for more information.

## OpenAPI Provider Spec Generator

A commonly used Interface Definition Language (IDL) for remote APIs is [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/); which provides its own schema and type definitions for how to interact with a given service.

Learn more about the [OpenAPI Provider Spec Generator](/terraform/plugin/code-generation/openapi-generator) that transforms an OpenAPI specification into a provider code [specification](/terraform/plugin/code-generation/specification).

## Framework Code Generator

Provider code specifications can be used to generate [Terraform Plugin Framework](/terraform/plugin/framework) Go code using the [Framework Code Generator](/terraform/plugin/code-generation/framework-generator).

## Workflow Example

Check out a demo that show some ideas on how to use the code generation tools in your development workflow in the [Workflow Example](/terraform/plugin/code-generation/workflow-example) section.
