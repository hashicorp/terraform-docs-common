# Plugin Development

Terraform is logically split into two main parts:

- **Terraform Core**: This is the Terraform binary that communicates with plugins to manage infrastructure resources. It provides a common interface that allows you to leverage many different cloud providers, databases, services, and in-house solutions.
- **Terraform Plugins**: Plugins are executable binaries written in Go that communicate with Terraform Core over an RPC interface. Terraform currently supports one type of plugin called [providers](/terraform/language/providers). Each provider plugin exposes an implementation for a specific service or tool, such as the [AWS provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest) or the [cloud-init provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/cloudinit/latest/docs).

## Get Started

- Learn more about [how Terraform Core interacts with plugins](/terraform/plugin/how-terraform-works).
- Learn the [design principles](/terraform/plugin/best-practices/hashicorp-provider-design-principles) HashiCorp developers follow when creating providers.
- Learn about [plugin framework benefits](/terraform/plugin/framework-benefits) and why we recommend using it to develop providers.
- Try these hands-on tutorials: [Implement a Provider with the Terraform Plugin Framework](/terraform/tutorials/providers-plugin-framework).
- Clone these template repositories on GitHub: [terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework).

## Develop and Share Providers

- Create new providers with the [framework](/terraform/plugin/framework) documentation.
- Maintain existing providers with the [SDKv2](/terraform/plugin/sdkv2) documentation.
- [Publish your provider on the Terraform Registry](/terraform/registry/providers/publishing) to make it publicly available.
- Get HashiCorp to [officially approve and verify](/terraform/docs/partnerships) your provider. Partner providers get a special badge on the Terraform Registry.
- Share internal-only providers within your organization with the [private registry](/terraform/registry/private).

## Get Support

- Ask questions and learn useful patterns in the [Terraform Providers section](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-providers/tf-plugin-sdk/43) of HashiCorp discuss.
- Report bugs to the [Terraform Plugin Framework Issue Tracker](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues).
