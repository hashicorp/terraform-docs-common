# Terraform Plugin Best Practices

A key feature of Terraform is its plugin system, which separates the details of
specific vendor APIs from the shared logic for managing state, managing configuration,
and providing a safe plan and apply lifecycle. Plugins are responsible
for the  implementation of functionality for provisioning resources for a
specific cloud provider, allowing each provider to fully support its unique
resources and lifecycles and not settling for the lowest common denominator
across all provider resources of that type (virtual machines, networks,
configuration management systems, et. al). While each provider is unique, over
the years, we accumulated recommended patterns that help ensure a consistent user experience when using Terraform for any given provider. This page describes best practices that generally apply to most
Providers, with a brief description of each, and link to read more. 

## Naming

[Naming][naming] resources, data sources, and attributes in plugins is how plugin authors
expose their functionality to operators and using patterns common to other plugins
lays the foundation for a good user experience.

## Versioning and Changelog

Terraform development serves two distinct audiences: those writing plugin code
and those implementing them. By clearly and consistently allowing operators to
easily understand changes in plugin implementation via version numbering and
documenting those changes, a trust is formed between the two audiences. In
[Versioning and Changelog][versioning] we cover some guidelines when deciding
release versions and how to relay changes through documentation.
