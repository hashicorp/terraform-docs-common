  appropriate for your provider.

# Which SDK Should I Use?

There are two SDKs that you can use to build Terraform providers:

* [SDKv2](/plugin/sdkv2) is the foundation for the majority of existing providers and continues to provide a stable development experience.
* [Terraform Plugin Framework](/plugin/framework) is a new SDK, realigning the provider development experience and abstractions around the updated architecture of Terraform. It represents our vision of the future of Terraform plugin development.

This guide helps you decide whether you should continue using SDKv2 or begin using the framework.

## Are You Writing a New Provider or Maintaining an Existing Provider?

If you maintain a large existing provider, we recommend that you begin migrating from SDKv2 to the framework by developing new resources and data sources with the framework. You can use [terraform-plugin-mux](/plugin/mux) to refactor the provider over time. Refer to the [Migrate to Terraform Plugin Framework](/plugin/sdkv2#migrate-to-terraform-plugin-framework) documentation for more details.

If you are developing a new provider, we recommend you build it entirely with the framework.


## Do You Need More Features Than SDKv2 Provides?

The framework provides several features that are not available in SDKv2. You
should consider using the framework if you would benefit from the ability to:

* Tell whether a value was set in the config, the state, or the plan.
* Tell whether a value is null, unknown, or the empty value.
* Have structured types like objects.
* Use nested attributes.
* Use any type as the elements of a map.
* Tell when an optional and computed field has been removed from a config.
* Implement schema-based validation that is relative to the current attribute or applies to any list, map, or set element.
* Return warning or error diagnostics during resource destruction.
* Read or write managed resource private state data.
